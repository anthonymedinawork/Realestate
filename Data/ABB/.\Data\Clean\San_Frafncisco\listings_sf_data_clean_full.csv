Plenty of 72-hour free parking in front. Free maps, breakfast food and advice about what to do in San Francisco. As part of the booking procedure, my house rules require you send me this sentence via the Airbnb message thread: ""Kevin, I have read your listing and house rules carefully and I agree to follow what you wrote."" If you don't, you forfeit your reservation and money.","This room can fit two people. Nobody else will stay in your room other than people in your group. The Queen bed sleeps two. There is a shared bathroom with a bathtub directly across from room. Up to seven people can fit in the other room that this room shares the bathroom with, but that is rare. It's much more common for there to be four people in the other room. I find that most guest groups don't wake up at the same time so bathroom conflicts are less common than you might think. Please read my house rules before you book and the day before your arrival, as there are extra charges for not adhering to some of the rules. I strive for transparency here, and the rules are reasonable and for your benefit. If you incur an extra charge, such as for early or late arrival and/or scheduling, for laundry service or to store your luggage, I give you weeks to pay and never demand it at once. The rule list is rather complete because I have been a host for over ten years now, so I have seen nearly ","Your own private room plus access to a shared bathroom across the hall.

Please read my house","This is a quiet, safe neighborhood on a substantial San Francisco hill. There are 60 acres of beautiful hiking trails just a five minute walk from my door. There is lots and lots of free parking in my neighborhood.","House Rule footnotes: 1.	I don’t allow check in before 9:00 on the first day of your reservation. I offer ‘early arrival’ from 9:01 to 18:59 for $20 per group of people that arrive together. The ‘early arrival’ fee is triggered by the following behavior: arriving during the early arrival time frame, scheduling an arrival during the early arrival time frame, asking if you may arrive during the early arrival time frame or hinting that you will or want to arrive during the early arrival time frame. Each scenario consumes my time, thus the charge. Since even asking if you can arrive early costs money, please don’t ask. I always allow early arrival for a fee, so please just tell me when you will arrive during the early arrival time frame. Late arrival is from 21:00 to 23:59 and the price and terms are the same as early arrival. This means you should not ask if you can arrive late, because I always allow it for a fee. If you simply ask, that triggers the fee, because asking consumes my time ",Public transit service to my house is outstanding. The 36 MUNI bus stops at my front door.,"During the hours of 7:00 to 22:00, your access to the living room, dining area and kitchen is conditioned on you overlooking any dirt, messiness or untidiness you discover. The living room, dining area and living room are closed from 22:00 to 7:00. I am not required to share the public areas of my home, and can easily uncheck the access boxes inside Airbnb's software that permit access. I clean the public areas nearly constantly and I really try to keep the place clean, but keeping up with thousands of guests is challenging. This policy means you may never leave a review that complains about the public areas of my house being dirty, because if you do then you are admitting you failed to uphold your end of our agreement which is for you to overlook any mess or disarray in the public areas. At best, I will vacuum the common areas one time per day, so you will see dust balls and dog hair here, as I have an active dog playing with guests and my family for hours daily. Stay somewhere less b","I live at the house in my own bedroom, and I work from home, so I am around to answer questions and help you make the most of your visit. When you arrive, I will offer you a free map of San Francisco. I will also suggest we sit at the dining room table to discuss what you want to do while in the City. I will point out on the map the places you mention. I will also suggest other places you may not have heard of or considered.  Many of my guests later write in their reviews how much value they obtained from this conversation. Lots of hosts on airbnb don't spend the time to help their guests make the most of their visit. I love helping out my guests, and you'll sense my enthusiasm when we meet. I love San Francisco and I'll help you love San Francisco too. I am not like the concierge at a fancy hotel. I don't collect commissions from any of the places I recommend.","Airbnb has no default house rules that hosts can use. Every host must write their own rules. A host without rules can’t enforce any common sense on guests, because Airbnb requires there be a written rule to enforce. Why should you care? Imagine you book a room at a shared house and a guest gets roaring drunk and starts screaming. Unless there is a house rule prohibiting that, Airbnb will allow it to continue, and the host is powerless to require the guest to quiet down or depart. Since my rules are long, I have summarized them up front, and then elaborated in the footnotes. To understand all of the rules, you’ll have to read the summary and the footnotes. To get the general idea, you only need to read the summary. Please don't let them intimidate you, because it's these rules that allow me to ensure my guests will have a great experience at my busy shared home. Here are the rules for my home: 1.	I charge extra if you do not check in between the free check in hours of 19:00 to 21:00.
