208345,557305,2011-09-22,1100017,István,"We came from Hungary, and wanted a cheap accomodation in the Bay area, and finally chose this one. 

The house is nice and clean, the host family is very kind and open-minded. Their hospitality is exemplary. If you need any help during your stay, feel free to ask them for any assistance!

If you want a warm place with a friendly, mindful family, I highly recommend you this accomodation.

208345,609510,2011-10-08,373641,Eran,"We had fun staying there, and with the other airbnb'ers there, it was even more fun. Angela and her husband were great hosts. Our kids had fun interacting with their kids as well. Would recommend!"
208345,805074,2011-12-25,687657,Amanda,"I did not personally stay there. I booked the accommodations for my parents so these comments are based on their feedback. 

1. angela was a great host, very nice lady. 

2. the kids were great. left chocolates and a welcome note. super cute. made my parents feel at home. 

overall, great place for a family-orientated environment. "
208345,861442,2012-01-14,617659,Margoth,"Angela's place was really great! She was very helpful and respectful person. They are a wonderful family, the kids are so lovely and disciplined, they are very well educated and you can share with them many histories they have for you. They are super kids and super cute!
We had a very good time in a beutiful and neat house with a wonderful view. The place was perfect for our needs and it was everything she offers. We highly recommend it and we are so grateful with the whole family. Thanks Angela!"
208345,890768,2012-01-30,1555652,Cullen,"Angela and her wonderful children, Samson and Isabella, were a joy to be around. Beautiful home and setting in the San Mateo area. Couldn't be more satisfied. 
"
208345,897904,2012-02-02,1503489,David,"Angela was such a wonderful host! She has all the answers for the questions you have regarding what to do with kids, where to eat and much more. My kids loved playing with Angela's adorable kids and othr guests. We had so much fun sharing lots of interesting conversation, cooking experience and even her homeschooling classes.

"
208345,1001175,2012-03-14,1792454,Meelika,"Angela was a wonderful hostess and her children were sweet and kind. The house, and the view from it, was absolutely beautiful. It is just walking distance away from a market place. Overall a great location, great family, great home. Totally recommended! We will definitely stay here again."
208345,1223120,2012-05-03,2164441,Ian,Great host and wonderful kids! We mostly did our own thing but Angela was around if we needed anything. 
208345,1286815,2012-05-15,2257901,Esther,"Excellent place to learn about America... also, you will truly enjoy the whole family...
I will be staying here again and again!"
208345,1430249,2012-06-06,3702156,Eva,"Angela is a very sweet host and her house is gorgeous and very clean. I like that she makes guests take off their shoes at the front door so as not to track dirt and other yucky things in the house. I stayed in the loft on a futon, and it was very spacious and comfy. The shared bathroom is extremely nice - much nicer than a 4-star hotel. I had to work very late and Angela was still up to let me in. Her son even made me a beautiful airplane envelope with some nice treats inside! A very pleasant experience. Thank you, Angela!"
208345,1483151,2012-06-14,1879996,Sugam,Angela is a great host and her home is clean and beautiful. 
208345,1500931,2012-06-17,2578616,Brian,"Angela was great.  Her kids are sweet and the home was very nice.  We enjoyed feeling like we were at home.  The only issue- and it really wasn't an issue- was the bathroom is in another bedroom occupied by other guests, requiring you to go into their room to use the bathroom.  I believe Angela is putting in a new bathroom for the loft guests and that will make a huge difference.  I would definitely recommend it though.  Very convenient access off the freeway.  Thanks Angela.  All the best.  "
208345,1677974,2012-07-10,2681459,Ran,Angela is a really good host. we enjoyed our stay very much.thanks for everything : ) 
208345,1950720,2012-08-11,291766,Michael,stayed in the loft this time around.  was as comfortable as the private room.
208345,1996956,2012-08-15,3162206,Naoaki,It's the great time to me. I stay in the loft but could keep my private. 
208345,2095088,2012-08-25,3231549,Michael,We are 4 German students that decided to go to San Francisco for a few days and we really enjoyed our time at Angela's house. She and her kids are very friendly and very open-minded. We did not have any problems at all. We would recommend her house to anybody who wants to visit San Francisco. Her house it not far away from public transportation so that you do not have to use a car. In addition Angela can give you some tips what you definitively have to do in San Francisco.
208345,2131497,2012-08-28,1757777,Nel,"Angela is a very gracious Hostess. She showed us how to get to get Cal-Train into SanFrancisco. 

The views from the loft are beautiful. When I come back thru I will see if she has the loft available again."
208345,2367147,2012-09-21,337833,Philipp,"Staying at Angela's was great. She was very accommodating and everything was perfect upon arrival although we booked very last minute. The kids are great, too - super well educated and fun to be around. the house itself is beautiful, large, well located and comes with everything you may need. would definitely stay there again. "
208345,2488238,2012-10-02,176890,Gary,We found Angela's home to be very warm and inviting. We did not spend a lot of time there because we were out sightseeing the fabulous Bay area which we could not get enough of. We would have liked to be able to talk to her more. She is a facinating person with clearly loved and adorable children.  We would definately stay there again if we were in the area. 
208345,2719616,2012-10-25,337833,Philipp,This was the third time we stayed with Angela and as always enjoyed it thoroughly. 
208345,2958925,2012-11-25,3321801,Arne,"We had such a good time at Angelas wonderful house. Angela and the kids were great and helpful all the time. We got recommendations for San Francisco and the Bay area as well. We stayed a week over Thanksgiving, an unknown celebration in Europe. Angela invited us to join the event and we had nice conversations, enjoyed music together and shared an unforgettable evening. We were so glad that we've chosen her home for our week in San Francisco so we could get better acquainted.

Thanks again, Angela!
"
208345,3182976,2012-12-29,4408882,Taras,"Next time when we need to go to Bay Area, we would prefer stay in Angela’s home. It was a pleasure to stay in this gorgeous home and it was a great pleasure to meet Angela and her family.  "
208345,3511241,2013-02-10,3149564,Rebecca,"Others have already said it so eloquently before, but it deserves to be reiterated: Staying with Angela and her family was a dream. Angela and her children welcomed myself and my two friends into their home as if it were our own. We even had the good fortune of meeting additional guests who were visiting from Shanghai. Sharing Angela's space was an experience beyond special!"
208345,3523519,2013-02-11,1291421,Christian,"I found my stay to be excellent.  First of all, Angela is VERY responsive and pleasant to talk to.  Secondly, the accommodations are quite reasonable and matches what you see on the picture.  There's a bathroom available for use downstairs, so I had no issue.

I think the thing that really left me with a favorable impression was I felt like I was allowed to be part of Angela's family during my stay.  Angela greeted me with a smile and a friendly home.  Both her children are pleasant and well-mannered.  Her son even left a welcome gift for me on my pillow!  The daughter was also adorable, and was happy to show me the merits of her new LEGO watch.  When I left, the daughter hugged my leg goodbye.  Needless to say, my heart melted.

I think anyone looking for both a clean accommodations and a very pleasant host interaction should consider staying here.  It's hard to imagine a more welcoming place.  "
208345,4393531,2013-05-02,5625292,Paolo,"This was a very good place for our Silicon Vally trip! Is not far from SF and not so far from other beautifull places in the valley. Every day we went to SF by train (30min walking) and we taken taxi when we came back. Angela, Isabella & Samson are great, happy sweet faimly! Is a very good place where everybody respects everybody. We met 5 people in 3 weeks and if we return to SF we'll come back in this fair house!
Paolo, Lorenzo & Andrea."
208345,4715144,2013-05-21,6201849,Shannon,I had a lovely time staying with Angela and her family.  They have a lovely house in a beautiful neighborhood that was close to everything I needed.  Thanks again for your hospitality Angela!
208345,5301399,2013-06-23,689765,Emmanuel,"Fantastic stay, fantastic family, Angela is very caring, very arranging, and the kids very entertaining and accommodating when room is missing! Great people staying in the house at the same time. Fantastic discussions in the evening. Great tips to meet VCs in the area. 
The house offers ample space and privacy if need be.
I'd recommend the place to anyone no matter his/her/their situation: family, single, couple, student, etc."
208345,5465942,2013-07-01,6670404,Huan,Angela was an excellent host.  Thank you for having me in your beautiful home!
208345,5502262,2013-07-02,5337535,Michael,"We had a great time on the loft. It had soft carpet, nice beds, and an excellent view. My brothers and I had an overall great stay, and hope to come again soon!"
208345,5709482,2013-07-13,6019155,Mick,"Angela's house was a welcoming and family-orientated place to stay. We'd recommend it if you want a homely atmosphere and other guests to interact with.
It's a nice quiet neighbourhood, convenient to both SFO and shops."
208345,6200950,2013-08-03,6274125,Natalia Isabel,"Ángela y sus hijos son muy amables y amorosos, la casa es bastante tranquila y cómoda, tiene todo lo necesario para disfrutar de tu estancia en San Mateo"
208345,6281710,2013-08-06,7337290,Antonio,"Angela is a good host! Beautiful house in San Mateo, close to San Francisco. Everything was ok during our stay in Angela's apartment."
208345,6333865,2013-08-08,5101326,Jeff & Christina,"Our stay with Angela was beyond amazing! That's a modest understatement:) Angela is truly a gracious Host. She is elegant, graceful, generally funny and a real soulful person, thru and thru. Nothing else could have been better prepared for our visit to SF. Angela thoughtfully gave us advice on things to see, helped us with travel plans and kindly and unselfishly made the most amazing crepes for breakfast! I would stay here - and will, hopefully - in a heart beat. Thanks a million, Angela for making the experience so great."
208345,6649669,2013-08-19,8188017,Danielle,"Angela's place was amazing! And her kids are the cutest, most gracious hosts one could ask for. We received welcoming tokens as soon as we walked through the door and a parting gift when we left, both from the tiniest host in the house :). It was so unexpected that it made the experience that much more special. For this being our first Airbnb experience, Angela and her family helped make it one to remember. Her city is beautiful, her family is great and I think her home really does have the best views in San Mateo. We had such a great time and felt so welcomed that we can't wait for our next visit to San Mateo. Angela's is definitely the best spot in town. "
208345,6834829,2013-08-26,3766316,Peter,"Angel was a lifesaver. She was able to step in at very short notice because our previous host cancelled on us at the last minute. She was very welcoming, whilst also respecting our privacy. The apartment is located in a quiet neighbourhood and has a fantastic view over the city. It can get a bit bright in the morning so bring an eyemask if that could be a problem. Apart from that, I would definitely stay there again!"
208345,6907995,2013-08-29,8375621,Dustin,"You will be living in a clean, well maintained, well equipped house. This is a really good place to stay."
208345,7344497,2013-09-16,8256451,Kamil,Anyone looking for a charming house near San Francisco will love Angela's home. The host is very friendly and helpfull. We highly recommend it :)
208345,7758100,2013-10-01,8924359,Janine,"This was an ideal situation. Angela is professional, easy going, used to the process of having guests come through the house and was quick to respond to inquiries via the website. It is nice to have access to a refrigerator/freezer, and I enjoyed being around her two kids who were polite, curious and a lot of fun. This is a good situation for anyone looking for an affordable option who does not mind stepping right into someone's home and life. Angela also demonstrated a genuine interest in getting to know her guests if they wanted to be sociable and was both generous and gracious. She comes highly recommended. "
208345,7976427,2013-10-10,8541397,Ruben,"Angela is a nice person, 
i like to stay at her place, 
nice beautiful area"
208345,8091144,2013-10-15,8642151,Gary,"      Our stay with Angela and her delightful children was the highlight of our time in the Bay Area.  It was very nice coming back to a comfortable home instead of a hotel.  The bed in the loft was very comfortable, and we never really felt any lack of privacy.  The best experience was with Angela and her children.  Angela is a genuinely friendly and open person, so we enjoyed just sitting and getting to know each other.  Just had much fun being with the children - brought my pump and balloons and did lots of balloon twisting - great fun!  
      The other guest were were very nice people whom we very much enjoyed getting to know as well
      Would Highly recommend Angela's Hosting to anyone"
208345,8763514,2013-11-16,9932574,Phil,"Angela was an awesome host! She has a wonderful family and very nice house. While it was only one night, we really enjoyed our stay with Angela and would absolutely stay there again. "
208345,8890509,2013-11-24,2486770,Jian,"We stayed with Angela for a week during our apartment hunt. The Loft View as well as the common areas are very modern, neat and comfortable. As the name implies, the loft offers a stunning view of the city light at night. We had a dedicated the bath and shared the kitchen with our host. We enjoyed playing and talking with the kids who are brilliant and most polite. "
208345,9289055,2013-12-18,9352901,Jiayi,"This house in San Mateo is indeed located in a very nice neighborhood! Angela, of course, a very nice host, with who you can feel free to talk to. She has majored film in college, so she is really artistic!
But, if you are gooing to visit san francisco downtown often and you don't want or not able to rent a car, I can't reconmond her nice house. For I suffered a lot from the long walk from the uphill to the train station to sanfo dowmtown........but I luckily got a ride from the nice people in san mateo every day! Haha, if you think you are lucky enough, strong-willed enough, or nature-loving enough, you can come to enjoy the nice loft view in the cute house in San Mateo!!"
208345,9847036,2014-01-13,3517585,Lenart,Angela kindly accepted us despite our late reservation. She was a very responsive and frinedly host. Thanks for a pleasant stay!
208345,10628441,2014-02-28,12517315,Janice,Angela accommodated me on short notice and she was a great host!  The home is beautiful and has an amazing view of the city.  Everything was clean.  Angela is a great chef- try to get a taste of her specially made kombucha!  Her kids are funny and a delight to be around.  I felt comfortable and at home.  
208345,11671041,2014-04-11,4777765,Sarah,Angela and her kids were great hosts! It was great spending time with them. The house was awesome; clean and comfortable. 
208345,12139258,2014-04-23,7267980,Julie,"My stay with Angela and her adorable kids was quick but comfortable. I was in the area on business and Angela was helpful in suggesting a route to get me to my meeting on time while avoiding Hwy 101. The home is in a nice residential area and was easy to find, the loft was very comfortable. It is important to note the loft is open, which was fine for me but one must be ok with not having a door.

As a bonus I left with a new supply of jokes thanks to Angela's son! "
208345,12418109,2014-05-01,14729099,Larry," I was on a short business trip and thought I would try staying with a family instead of the usual hotel. I was pleasantly surprised by Angela's hospitality and generosity.  I had an awesome time with Angela and her two children, Sampson and Isabella!   The home is beautiful with fantastic views.  There's a park and open space nearby which was great for my morning run. I highly recommend a stay with Angela and her family! "
208345,13155909,2014-05-20,227247,Jonathan,We stayed an entire week in Angela's loft space. Definitely beautiful views of the city and sunrise from bed. We were sadly too busy to spend as much time as we'd have liked with Angela and her kids but they were lovely. Thanks Angela!
208345,13394149,2014-05-26,11591750,Caglar,"Wonderful and peaceful place. Angela and her family are very nice people. helpful and very friendly family. ı will recommend all of my friends Angela's place.

With best regards..."
208345,17739414,2014-08-17,13310677,Nathan,Angela and her kids were very welcoming and thoughtful. We stayed for 3 months during a summer internship.
208345,18048745,2014-08-21,12044332,Philippe,"notre hote nous a recu rapidement elle etait très occupée avec d'autres clients .le quartier etait tres bien mais un peu loin de San Francisco
nous etions logés à 4 sur une mezzanine de 10m2, canapé pas très confortable et matelas en plastique gonflable pour nos 2 enfants du camping mais pas un loft confortable
nous étions dans le passage d'une autre chambre louée, difficile pour l'intimité et la SDB et WC était situés dans le garage et très petit commun aux autres clients;
dans la maison nous etions au total 9 clients, d'autres étaient couchés sur les canapés du séjour. La maison est vraiment rentabilisée au max au détriment du confort des hotes
Dommage"
208345,18346602,2014-08-25,2962530,Melanie-Anne,"Whenever I need a place to stay in San Mateo, I go to Angela's :) I'm a repeat customer so I have nothing but praise!"
208345,18488787,2014-08-27,7378171,Denise,"The house in the photo looks amazing, and the family sounded so interesting in the ad, which is why we chose to stay here. We were expecting a nice relaxing time at the end of a long road trip, especially for the children and were disappointed with the sleeping arrangements, which didn't allow for either privacy or relaxation at all. Angela failed to inform us that there would be other paying guests in the house at the same time as ourselves, and to our surprise, there were a total of 12 guests the night we arrived!!! One French family were actually sleeping on the sofa and floor in the living area pictured in this photo! They were pretty shocked! Our family of four had been placed on the upstairs landing, again visible in this photo, which meant we had no closed door to our space and were a 'walk through' area for a couple staying in a bedroom just next to this landing. For all 12 guests, Angela provided access only to a very small shower, toilet and sink washroom, which was actually in the garage part of the house, so we had to walk through the kitchen to get there. Although Angela herself was very pleasant, and we certainly enjoyed meeting her children, I feel it is important, through respect to other Airbnb travellers, to warn people of the circumstances here, and for the price, we would not wish to return."
208345,19282752,2014-09-09,19014355,Richard,"My girlfriend and I stayed at Angela's for ~2 weeks after relocating to the Bay Area. Everything was great. Angela and her kids were welcoming, the house was big and bright and the location was convenient (we did have a car)."
208345,19451419,2014-09-12,114125,Taras,"Review? 
Its 4.5* for a reason, (will check out who didnt score 5* and have a word!).
I would say home from home but its so much better than mine. 
Wonderful host, house, view, chickens (very small chicken house though ;-)  ) and everything else."
208345,20494093,2014-09-30,11576311,Nerea,"We had a great time!!!! It was a pity that we had to leave because our children and Angela's children seemed to get on well. Our children played with all the games and toys in the house. 
While our stay, there was a problem with the bathroom but Angela solved it out inmediately.
The other guests staying in the housre were very respectful. We have to thank once again the french guests because they were so kind...they even gave us a cooler for the road trip we are going to do. Merci.
Angela has also helped us everytime we have needed her. Thank you very much!!!!"
208345,20664021,2014-10-03,3286040,Parker,Staying in Angela's place was perfect - the location was very convenient (close to airport and not too far from San Francisco).  We had good time staying there as her kids are fun to hang out with.  San Mateo is a quaint place and you don't have to deal with parking or traffic compared to staying in the city.
208345,21046338,2014-10-10,17867937,Mihoko,"Angela's house was very comfortable for us!
We stayed at the loft space with beautiful landscape.
And we used her kitchen to cook. 
Only 10min, for a shopping center.
We appreciate her concern and recommend her house to other people too! ^_^"
208345,21367568,2014-10-15,4258815,Fei,Angela had a classic Airbnb spot - her house was bright and pretty and she was very welcoming.  Her two kids are very adorable.  The house had a very nice view of the Bay Area.  We shared the room with two other sets of guests.  Meeting others on the trip is part of the perk for using airbnb.  
208345,23200880,2014-11-24,23991491,Farrah,Angela and children were very gracious to us upon our arrival and throughout our stay. Angela helped accommodate our needs while staying in her open loft area to make the bed private enough for me being a nursing mother. It isn't a private room so if you don't mind not having complete privacy you should be fine. Her house is beautiful and she works hard to keep it that way so you need to make sure to clean up after yourself and your kids. She has guests living on her couch downstairs but they were nice and didn't mind the noise our two little ones made. I had the pleasure of getting to Angela a little. She is an inspiration to me since I will be a homeschooling mother as well. I also got healthy cooking tips from her as well! Thanks Angela! Anyone who decides to stay will definitely enjoy their experience. 
208345,26444390,2015-02-13,8715793,Darren,"I booked a room on behalf of two my student interns coming to work for me in Palo Alto, and it was a pleasure and delight to work with Angela.  During their stay, Angela was a wonderful host and and she made every attempt to make my students feel welcome and comfortable.  During their whole stay, her communication was excellent and I had a high level of trust and confidence with Angela. With Angela"
208345,26853877,2015-02-20,4957342,Katie,"Angela's home is so wonderful! Very  good location, easy to find and so beautiful bay view! elegant,cozy loft place shared with friends, cool experience! very comfortable. I do love Angela's place! Hope to come back again."
208345,27114649,2015-02-25,1398131,Gerald,"The neighborhood is really nice, and the view is amazing.  There is natural lighting from 3 directions.  The space was exactly as I expected, and Angela was a great host."
208345,27966204,2015-03-15,6310031,Kat,"Angela was a very gracious host and her kids are fantastic!  I felt very welcomed and comfortable in their home.  I even got to enjoy some dessert with them on my first night :) The futon in the loft is super comfy and I got to see a gorgeous sunrise through the big upstairs windows.  All in all, a great airbnb experience."
208345,28971293,2015-04-01,30080508,So-Yeon,숙소 지역도 좋았고 호스트도 반갑게 맞이하고 놀러 갈 곳에 대한 좋은 정보들을 알려줬었습니다.
208345,31086765,2015-05-01,9023711,Petr,"Amazing experience! I stayed with Angela and her kids for couple of days and have to say I felt like at home. Everything was clean and well prepared. Angela is very friendly person, so are both her kids, and her recommendations were very useful. Next time in San Mateo I'll stay again!"
208345,31687076,2015-05-08,3190062,Alfredo,"Angela is a wonderful host, and She and her kids made us feel welcomed in their home. We stayed for one night in the loft which was perfect since it had ample space for three people and lots of natural light in the morning/day (it offers a nice view). Angela also gave us great suggestions on places to see on our journey to San Diego. A pleasant experience! Thank you Angela!"
208345,40555841,2015-08-01,8715793,Darren,Angela is a great host and does her best to make you feel at home!
208345,45167560,2015-08-31,962182,Rupert,We loved staying at Angela's great house and can highly recommend the place to anyone travelling to the Bay Area. Angela makes sure you have an awesome time.
208345,46014603,2015-09-07,2600120,Andrew,Angela was very warm and friendly when we met her at her home. A great place that's not too far from sf.

208345,47855014,2015-09-21,48799185,Samuel,Fantastic host! Very accommodating even when we had random requests she worked with us to make our time in the house super pleasant. 
208345,47982148,2015-09-22,26981755,Jan,As already described in my longer review I had a great time at this place. Angela is a very friendly and helpful host. All in all a true and great Silicon Valley experience. 
208345,48488826,2015-09-26,2178946,Gilbert,Staying with Angela was very pleasant. The views were great from the room and her place is in a nice quiet neighborhood.  
208345,50991325,2015-10-16,45691069,Joe,Amazing.  Family is great I had a great time.  I really enjoy staying there.
208345,52385257,2015-10-28,40128984,Anthony,Angela nous a généreusement accueilli dans sa maison qui est vraiment agréable! Elle à était au petit soin pour nous. Sa maison sur les hauteur de San José est magnifique.
208345,54348557,2015-11-18,44097025,Andreas,Great house with a excellent kitchen! Close to a super grocery store. A short drive will take you to downtown SF! The host showed interest in our trip and was happy to help! Great company!
208345,72569178,2016-05-03,9023711,Petr,"Amazing stay, as always! This time around with an amazingly delicious veggie 7 course dinner - awesome! Thanks Angela, looking forward to stay with you again soon."
208345,80046433,2016-06-15,1237130,Piotr,"Angela was a wonderful host. The place was excellent and had absolutely everything we needed. 
Honestly I was a little scared of all the rules written on airbnb - turns out the host and place are absolutely frictionless. 
Highly recommended if you're staying in bay area! We'll be coming back!"
208345,80357104,2016-06-17,5405502,Patryck,"Teníamos el avión muy pronto y fue el sitio perfecto. Angela y sus niños nos recibieron como amigos. Realmente fue genial y nos hubiera gustado quedarnos más tiempo.
Bravo Angela por ser tan agradable y tener una casa tan acogedora."
208345,83849582,2016-07-04,10567358,Charina,"It was a delight staying in Angela's home. My 2 daughters and I stayed in the loft which was fine for the 1 night. Angela's home is clean, spacious, and close to amenities and highway. I had a chance to meet Angela and her 2 kids and they are super nice. Thanks again Angela for accommodating my booking snafu! I would highly recommend staying here.  :)"
208345,99701931,2016-09-05,74847049,Linde,"Angela is a really nice person with a lovely home. 
The room we stayed in was no private room but met all the expectations. But there are no curtains, so you might want to bring a sleeping mask. 
There is also the possibility to do your laundry. 
Overall a plaisant stay!"
208345,103455973,2016-09-22,1460648,Xue,"周是位伟大的房东!特别友善,很感激她第二次接待了我们!家里收拾的特别干净!一对孩子也非常可爱,太喜欢他们了!感谢Zhou!"
208345,129424413,2017-01-30,35840150,Kazuo,"My son and myself stayed at their loft and enjoyed communication with her, her children and another airbnb guest. We talked and played some games together.  They are all so nice and happy people!! "
208345,163458748,2017-06-24,136295948,Kit,Private neighborhood and beautiful home with the best panoramic view of the entire SF Bay Area! Quiet cul-de-sac with lots of parking. Easy access to all freeways. Clean home and friendly family - so cute! Will definitely be back and highly recommend to all my friends!
208345,180953913,2017-08-11,125642511,君君,"Angela really is a terrific host, expect to stay at her place next time"
208345,182913992,2017-08-15,16922536,R.K.,Angela was a great host. Communication was steady and the place was exactly as described. In a quiet neighbourhood and a clean place. Multiple people in the house along with her family make it a communal type environment. We shared stories and laughter. I have no hesitation staying here again and recommending to others. It's a quick drive to airport and not to bad of a drive to downtown San Francisco. 
208345,233237320,2018-02-08,169590447,Helen,"Great stay beyond any expectations I could have imagined!  Upstairs master suite with private bath attached.  Super comfy organic mattress.  Gorgeous view of the bay on one side of the room.  View of robins and waxwings eating winter berries off a toyon growing on a steep bank just outside the window on the other side of the room.  Very clean and stocked with extra blankets, towels, toiletries, and anything else a visitor might need.  Located in the gorgeous San Mateo hills and a short drive away from the Crystal Springs Reservoir.  As for the host, Angela is super friendly and an amazing cook!  I was fortunate enough to be invited to a few meals during my stay, including lemon ricotta crepes, a slice of lemon meringue pie, jackfruit tacos, and an Indian dinner--all made from scratch by Angela, who is a professional caterer!!!  (And just in case that doesn't give you a proper sense as to how amazing the graciously shared meals were, I'll confess: At one of those meals, I remember looking down at the juices that ran off my jackfruit taco and literally wishing I wasn't seated at a table with others so that I could lick my plate clean.  Fortunately--also regrettably--her son, Samson, promptly cleared my plate and saved me from embarrassing myself in front of a table full of people.)  This is definitely going to be my default booking any time I need to visit the area!"
208345,246631563,2018-03-25,107492807,Lwa,"Angela’s place is a great Airbnb to stay in for the short term daytime professional or student. As far as location goes you will be extremely close to everything Downtown San Mateo and San Francisco has to offer. Overall the neighborhood and home are friendly, safe and convenient. I would definitely stay here again."
208345,260705300,2018-05-04,4477059,Dom,"Wonderful place, i highly recommend!"
208345,267773953,2018-05-22,190185231,Brynn,Angela was an amazing host! She was a very cool person who offered the best suggestions. We had great conversations and met really interesting people who were staying there as well! It was a great experience and we will definitely be back!
208345,305700739,2018-08-11,186375465,Skyler,"I stayed in Angela's loft for over 10 weeks during the summer while doing an internship at a nearby tech startup, so I think it's safe to say I definitely have a good feel for the place. Here are some things you might want to know! 1. Angela is awesome. She's extremely nice and reasonable. If you have any problems she's super helpful in problem solving. She's very easy to talk to and has a million suggestions for fun stuff to go do on the weekend. Honestly just a top tier host and human being (: 2. Read the description carefully! There is a lot of important information on there and everything written is written for a reason. Read it twice and read it slow. If you read through it you'll have no surprises when you show up. 3. This is not a private space. I'd only recommend this if you're chill with noise and people. Between other guests, dogs, family, catering, etc... it can get chaotic. But if you're not a huge grouch the chaos is a big part of the fun and the charm. It really just starts to feel like a second home. There are constantly interesting people floating through and lots of fun stuff going on. Plus the dogs Angela watches are SO CUTE. But don't worry, you can always just escape upstairs, put in some headphones, and tune out to your favorite Netflix series if you need to decompress. 4. If you're a nerd like me you're probably wondering about the internet. It's around 100 mbps up and down, but does have some spikes. For anything like watching Netflix or general browsing this is more than fast enough. If you do a lot of online gaming you will notice the occasional ping spike. 5. The area this house is in is super nice. I'm sure anyone would feel 100% safe walking around at night (I went on a walk literally every single night I was here). It's just a nice neighborhood. It's within 7-12 minutes walk of some nearby bus stops that can get you around. I would not say commuting from this place is a cakewalk, but it's totally doable. I used a combination of bus and long board to get around the entire summer and it went just fine. Make sure to do your homework and see what public transit options will suite your needs. I should also mention the new Uber express pool system makes using Uber only slightly more pricey than public transit. I used this a lot during my stay when the bus wasn't a great option. 6. On a final note, I will mention this loft is surrounded by 270 degrees of large windows with no blinds. The nice part of this is I never needed an alarm to wake me up for work as the sun did a fine job of that haha. However, you might have trouble sleeping in past 9am on the weekends if you're sensitive..."
208345,313653649,2018-08-25,30970569,Eun,"The house is so gorgeous, and Angela and her kids were so lovely!"
208345,316713557,2018-08-31,210983227,Alex,We loved staying here. Felt really comfortable while in her home.
208345,325125808,2018-09-18,213047218,Juste,Angela was amazing. Super hospitality! We stayed in her house for five nights and it was super cool. The view from massive windows was breathtaking and the kitchen has every equipment that you can need to cook. I can definitely recommend this place to others!
208345,328283145,2018-09-25,131989446,Tom,"Very relaxed environment, Angela and her family are wonderful and very accommodating! Highly recommended!"
208345,329409796,2018-09-28,35520338,Nichole,I was pleasantly surprised by how cozy my loft was! Angela was an excellent host and her kids were mature and well behaved when I met them. This is a bustling house with many guests so you have a great opportunity to talk and swap travel tips!
208345,331473221,2018-10-02,125634234,Eduardo,"Angela es una excelente persona.
En todo momento nos sentimos cómodos. Los espacios para dormir son limpios.
Nos dio un kit de bienvenida, el cual incluía cepillo, pasta dental, café, agua, y snacks.
Nos recomendó lugares para salir a conocer de SFO.
La ubicación es perfecta si quieres viajar a SFO o cualquier parte de la bahía.
Totalmente recomendado."
208345,334354555,2018-10-08,218810646,Ronald,nice for a quick stay... Área around the (Website hidden by Airbnb) beautifull..
208345,403767663,2019-01-21,99571037,Antoinette,I’ve stayed here twice and every time it’s a wonderful experience. I will definitely stay again!
796558,10126228,2014-02-01,10697143,Stephanie,"Lisa was so warming and welcoming!  Great room and area for commuting to the city for work.  100% above and beyond making me feel comfortable and will be staying with her again!  

Home is within walking distance to downtown Burlingame, close to airport, caltrain everything!  Thanks so much Lisa!"

796558,12223979,2014-04-26,1238369,Mari,"Lisa's place is absolutely adorable! Everything about her place is beautiful and Instagramable. She had prepared a welcome snack when I checked in with grapes, hummus, cheese, crackers, olives, dried tomatoes. The bed is luxuriously comfortable and it's really stone's throw away from the SF airport. Just a few blocks away from the downtown Burlington area with tons of restaurants and shops. "

"
796558,13203427,2014-05-21,1533677,Youngah,"Amazing place with the most gorgeous interior design. The location is unbeatable as it is walking distance to the multitude of boutiques and cafes and restaurants near in Burlingame. Only 10 minutes from the SFO airport and so quiet and peaceful. I hit it off with Lisa from the get go and our conversations lasted hours! Not to mention the cutest cat and dog residents, Otis and Julia. Thank you so much for letting me stay and I only hope we can stay in touch in the future!!"
796558,13249821,2014-05-23,2776640,Jackie,"This is a truly lovely bungalow, and Lisa is an exceptional host. The airbnb room upstairs is beautifully and tastefully outfitted, and he leaves a marvelous plate of high-quality cheese/crackers/fruit for the guest to enjoy. She also provides simple items (e.g. oatmeal) for breakfast in the morning. Terrific location and marvelous house."
796558,14166543,2014-06-13,13035464,Eileen,"Lisa was the most welcoming and accomodating host. She ran out to greet me even with my late arrival (1am!) and had an amazing spread of snacks waiting for me. The room was neat, clean and the bed was particularly comfortable. The only downside (which was completely out of the host's control), was waking up to some construction noise early in the next morning."
796558,14802074,2014-06-26,105235,Scott,Clean and comfortable space at a great location on the peninsula between SF and SV and a short drive from SFO.
796558,14849517,2014-06-27,7220078,Ali,"Lisa was a very gracious host who allowed me to stay at her place on short notice.  It was quiet, peaceful, and the queen bed was extremely comfortable!  I was exhausted from work and Lisa brought me fresh cut fruit, wine, and other snacks.  It was also located very close to the Burlingame CalTrain station, all in all I would highly recommend her place!"
796558,14893699,2014-06-28,16752977,Steven,Awesome place and host! I wish I could have stayed longer. Lisa was very nice and even stayed up after my flight was delayed.
796558,15083713,2014-07-01,15907550,Cayci,"Lisa is a wonderful host!  The house is lovely, clean, and in a very walkable area. Lisa even dropped me off at the airport. I definitely recommend. "
796558,15224804,2014-07-05,1710997,Edwin,"Road trip from Hell!
I finally arrived a day later than I planned. Lisa warmly greeted this weary traveler, gave a quick tour of her abode, then ushered my upstairs to my bedroom and to the most comfortable bed I had ever slept in. Sure were about 500 pillows (ok, maybe I exaggerate a bit), but once I moved the first 400 and climbed under the sheets, I was out and thankful not to be sleeping in my car at a rest stop.
Lisa is a very charming and considerate host. Her house close to public transportation and the small town shops in Burlingame. I highly recommend her and her home and look forward to staying there again."
796558,16329340,2014-07-25,18375097,Anthony,"Everything was way better than expected. The place felt like home, all the way down to to the animal company. The location is very convenient to walk to nice restaurants and groceries, and drive to most anything in the area.

I WAS thinking about checking out a bunch of airBNnB places in the area, now I might just make this a standard."
796558,16382912,2014-07-26,17226865,Andrew,Lisa was a great host and I really appreciated her outstanding communication in coordinating my arrival. I needed extra flexibility and she was able to accommodate me 100%.
796558,16548690,2014-07-29,7409832,Naomi,"Lisa was a hospitable and flexible host. Very kind and considerate, had food and wine prepared for me when I arrive, and was just all around nice and accommodating. The Cozy Queen room has a very comfortable bed and a sweet view of the garden. I slept well and had a nice stay. Would recommend for anyone else visiting family in Burlingame, or as a charming alternative to hotels in the area. Be sure that you are a dog lover however, and ok with sharing a bathroom with the other guests."
796558,16646361,2014-07-30,5927477,Erin,"I didn't get to meet Lisa in person, but she communicated well through texts and AirBnB.  The house is just as adorable as is shown.  Everything is very Anthropologie/Shabby Chic.  The neighborhood couldn't be better and the location is AWESOME!  Stacks is just a couple blocks away and California Avenue is RIGHT THERE.  If you were someone using CalTrain to get to the city, it is the perfect place!

Lisa left a bottle of wine in the room which was a nice surprise.  The kitchen is stocked and had I stayed longer I would have definitely cooked a little something.  Sharing a bathroom with the other folks staying there wasn't that bad, we coordinated the morning and there is a little powder room downstairs off the kitchen that you can use if needed.

The only downside I can report is that being upstairs during the summer without a/c and only one window that opened fully in the bedroom was a drag.  It was a warm night and since the windows are double hung and there isn't a fan it was hard to get any air circulation.  Also, the windows lack screens, so you have buggy visitors throughout the night."
796558,16854131,2014-08-03,3350072,Jodine,"Lisa was a great host and even made us a fruits platter when we arrived late at night. She was friendly and the room was comfortable. Thank you Lisa, really appreciate your good hospitality! "
796558,17178712,2014-08-08,18090781,Linda,"I had a great experience with Lisa.  Her home is so nice and warm, and Lisa's hospitality wonderful.  I was welcomed with a nice cheese and fruit plate which hit the spot because I arrived late in the evening.   The location is very special and most evenings I walked downtown and through the neighborhood.  "
796558,17648149,2014-08-15,19312338,Martha,"The listing was exactly what we expected.  Lisa was ""southern charming"" and more than accommodating.  It was a pleasure to be in her darling cottage.  I slept well each night and was greater with amenities each morning.  I had my privacy.  It was clean and quaint.  I would definitely stay again.  The one downside, but it was not a problem for me, was the shared bathroom.  Lovely setting and lovely neighborhood.  I walked to Starbucks each morning and dined in downtown Burlingame each night and had a wonderful time walking in this close small town only 13 miles from San Francisco.  Good job, Lisa!"
796558,17987198,2014-08-19,19991730,Tara,"After several hours of travel I arrived at this adorable house. I was greeted with smiles by Lisa, another guest and this adorable doggy. The room was described perfectly. When I got to the room Lisa had setup a tray of fruits, cheese, candy, and wine which was a prefect snack after a long day. The house was super clean and you couldn't even tell that there was a dog there. I definitely felt welcome.

The neighborhood is really nice and convient to the highway and walking distance to local restaurants and stores. Which was prefect since I was only there for a short trip.

Lisa's hospitality was wonderful!"
796558,18201549,2014-08-23,15588899,Terry,Lisa was amazing as I started my first week of work! She provided everything I needed plus more and the home was very comforting. I highly recommend Lisa for your stay in the Bay Area. 
796558,18612475,2014-08-28,20513965,Nancy,My 2 night stay at Lisa's could not have been more welcoming and pleasant.  The home is in a lovely area of Burlingame and the path up to the front door really looks just as the photo shows...lined with flowers.  The room was set up perfectly with the unexpected welcome in the way of a gourmet fruit and cheese tray along with a selection of wines (red or white).  The room is cozy and the queen bed is fit for a Queen.  
796558,19094808,2014-09-06,18375097,Anthony,"Just as great the 2nd time, I'd recommend it to family and friends."
796558,19441318,2014-09-12,20953925,Katie,"I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with Lisa...the home was lovely and inviting; the room was perfect and the bed was heavenly. The home was super clean and it is obvious that Lisa takes great pride in ownership. I was greeted with a warm, friendly welcome and bottle of wine! I would definitely stay at Lisa's again and highly recommend you stay there, too."
796558,20294898,2014-09-27,10642851,Warren,"Lisa was an amazing host. She was extremely friendly and accommodating. The house was great and a perfect ""home-base"" while I was in town on business. 
The house is right near downtown Burlingame with its selection of high end shopping and dining. 
The close proximity to the Caltrain makes getting around the bay area a breeze! 
All in all it was a great place to stay and I would highly recommend it!"
796558,20712368,2014-10-04,1256317,Bingbing,"Lisa is a great host, very accommodating. We stayed for five days and had a wonderful experience. Her place is very homey and filled with antique decorations. The place is so close to Burlingame shopping and the cal station, very walkable. BTW, we love the easy breakfast she prepared every morning."
796558,21318074,2014-10-14,8107119,Rui,Lisa was a superb host. Here place is amazing and very clean. She had a bottle of Red Wine and a tray of fruit when I arrived. She was beyond accommodating and I would stay here again. Thank You Lisa!
796558,21444213,2014-10-17,3940718,Brian,Great place.  Lisa was a phenomenal host and great conversationalist.  Would definitely recommend.
796558,21848010,2014-10-25,22342963,Rissa,"I wish I could give a million stars to Lisa. She is amazing. This was my first time using AirBnB and so I was quite skeptical. However, her kindness and adorable house far far exceeded my expectations. She was so kind and welcoming and really made me feel at home in her beautiful house. Her house is very clean and comfortable. I felt very spoiled. The bed was so so comfortable with high quality linens. I was in town for business and she was very accommodating to me schedule and all my needs. Lisa put out fresh berries, yogurt, granola and tea for me every morning for breakfast. Her house is in a great neighborhood as well, with anything I needed only a few blocks away. In summary, Lisa truly made this an incredible experience and I highly recommend staying with here! You will not be disappointed, in fact, you will probably be blown away like I was!"
796558,21993506,2014-10-27,6759167,Megan,"Lisa was an incredible host!  She made my trip to San Francisco incredibly enjoyable.  The house and room are lovely and I arrived to a plate of cheese, fruit and nuts and bottles of water in my room.  She was extremely accommodating and even connected me with a trusted Lyft driver as I needed transportation to and from a wedding.  The morning I was heading out, she offered a buffet of breakfast food before I left for the airport.  She really went above and beyond to make my stay with her comfortable.  I highly recommend staying with Lisa!"
796558,22674563,2014-11-11,23128822,Rob,"Lisa made my quick weekend in San Francisco so easy and welcoming with 5-star accommodations at an extremely affordable price.  If you are looking for a simply room to stay in with all of the amenities of home, then look no further."
796558,22969119,2014-11-18,6111971,Hariton,Perfect host and a very cosy and homy expirience
796558,23066123,2014-11-22,22491594,Forrest,"Was attending a conference at a large Hotel near the Airport, and rather than stay at the Hotel (which was located next to the freeway with absolutely nothing nearby to walk too), opted instead for Lisa's BnB.  It was a great choice as there are a ton of nice shops and restaurants within just a short walk in a very pleasant neighborhood and getting a ride to the conference at the hotel cost less than the hotel parking garage."
796558,23904666,2014-12-14,21348787,Jos,"I was in the Bay Area for a ten day business trip. Usually I stay in one of the many soulless hotels that the area offers, but this time I opted for a more personal experience in the form of Lisa's airbnb offering. What a find! The house is a lovely wooden 100 year old family home. Lisa is a wonderful hostess, friendly, chatty, welcoming, hospitable. I was sorry I had to leave! I felt a bit like I was a long lost family member coming to stay :-)

The house is located very conveniently around the corner from Burlingame Ave, where there are shops and restaurant. The Peet's on  that street opens at 6am, which is quite a boon for the jet lagged traveller... Parking is easy and the Caltrain is just a crawl away.

All in all amazing value and I will certainly come back."
796558,25418214,2015-01-15,23748526,Harvey,"Lisa was a spectacular host and really raised the bar for what I expect from Airbnb.  When I checked in, she even greeted me with a cheese and wine platter!  The house and room were amazing, I just wish I had more time to stay there...  "
796558,25688470,2015-01-23,19360454,William,Lisa Myshall Brady was a very good hostess during my stay at her B&B. The neighborhood seemed very safe and pleasant for walks with large trees. And it was very easy to walk 2 blocks to several great restaurants on Burlingame. The house is about 100 years old but has been kept up fairly well and was tastefully decorated. I personally prefer older buildings where it feels more like you are at home.
796558,26113778,2015-02-03,25106109,Cyndi,"By far the best host ever!!!! She's kind thoughtful and a loving person. I was in Lisa's home for two weeks my room was cozy very clean, loved the area. I had to stay an extra day she was very accommodating, we walked her dog around by the bay and it was beautiful, I mentioned I had never seen the ocean, she took her entire day to take me we drove to Half Moon Bay and many times I was over whelmed with joy, the fact that she took her day and turned it into my day, well I will for ever be grateful for the experience. This experience at her home was by far the best.

The room was small but comfortable, and I slept well, though I'd suggest packing earplugs b/c early train whistles might bother some people.

The next morning, Lisa set out a delicious breakfast with beverages, fresh fruit, granola, yogurt, and coffee cake. My husband met me at Lisa's early in the morning, coming in on another flight, and Lisa invited him to join me for breakfast. Much appreciated. We enjoyed chatting with Lisa before she left for work.

I should also comment that Lisa has a great aesthetic and her home reflects her stylish, eclectic taste.

The location was convenient to the Caltrain and wasn't too far from the airport.

Lisa is a great host whose home makes a great place to stay if one needs a place to stay near the airport."
796558,27372800,2015-03-02,11024686,Katey,"Lisa was a delightful host and offered all the comforts of a bed and breakfast. Especially worth noting was the delicious breakfast spread Lisa left out in the morning as well as a snack upon arrival. I would recommend a stay with Lisa for anyone looking to stay near the airport or in close proximity to the city. Thanks so much again, Lisa!"
796558,27857654,2015-03-13,12666917,Eugene,"Lisa was a kind and thoughtful host, going out of her way to make me feel welcome and my stay pleasant. The room was clean and comfortable, bed large and soft, breakfast delicious and the house very cozy.

The house is in perfect place to go for an evening walk and enjoy the town and the weather. 

This has been a perfect AirBnB experience, I can not recommend it enough."
796558,28108443,2015-03-17,11270887,Michelle,"From the moment I stepped into the house, to the moment I left, I felt very, very welcomed by Lisa. She is an excellent host and a wonderful conversationalist. She is also very respectful of personal space, so if you don't feel like talking she makes you feel comfortable just going up to your room. The snacks are amazing and the house is clean and inviting. "
796558,28354653,2015-03-22,18895829,Tracy,"My stay can be summed up in two words: absolutely delightful. The house and bedroom where I stayed was lovely. I appreciated the special touches like the fruit, cheese and wine upon arrival and the breakfast in the morning. Lisa is a delight as well, she is a very personable and passionate host. The house is about a block away to many excellent shops and restaurants. Burlingame is an oasis compared to the hustle and bustle of the city, yet the city is only a short drive or train ride away. Public transportation is close by as well and frequent. "
796558,29648654,2015-04-10,7873381,Adam,"What can I say. Saying with Lisa was one of the most enjoyable Airbnb experiences I've had. She is a sweetheart, respectful of one's space and a delightfully accommodating to her guests. Lisa treated me to some welcome brownies and raspberries that were delicious. But beyond being a gorgeous and kind host she was a joy to relax and talk to. The room was majestically appointed, extremely comfortable and homely. The pets add another layer of enchantment to what was a perfect couple of days stay. Also, location wise you can't get closer to SFO and just a short wander round the corner is the quaint and calm Main Street of Burlingame. Thank you Lisa, you are a doll and I hope our paths cross once again in the future."
796558,29700107,2015-04-11,1164334,Anders,"My wife and I loved our stay with Lisa. The house is beautiful, and the room was exactly what we needed. The location was also super convenient. Lisa went above and beyond to make our stay great. She was extremely friendly and responsive, and also provided breakfast in the morning. If you're looking to stay near Burlingame, stay here! "
796558,29802418,2015-04-12,27612029,Roy,This house like its owner has charm personality and a welcoming feel. The house is tucked away very close to the shopping and cafe quarters in Burlingame and has parking off street if requested. the home is. The home is comfortable and very well equipped.

Thank you for making the stay so special Lisa.
796558,30058164,2015-04-16,13534462,Brittney,"Lisa was by far the most incredibly woman I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. If there was ever a time I felt that I was exactly where I should be, this was it. Her home was very lovely, welcoming, and gave me a sense of comfort from the moment I walked in. Lisa greeted me at the door with a warm and loving smile and it felt as if I knew her my entire life. If you are looking for a home away from home, this is the place to stay. Thank you for everything, Lisa - you are wonderful!"
796558,30240430,2015-04-19,30248844,Monica,"Lisa is an excellent hostess!  She is so sweet, my flight got in pretty late and she stayed up and was so welcoming and offered to make me food.  Her beautiful home is very clean, cute and comfy.   She suggested a restaurant nearby and I'm so glad she did because the area was  amazing. I didn't realize that there were so many stores and restaurants nearby. The experience was amazing. Lisa made my first b&b experience a great one. "
796558,30799725,2015-04-27,30270912,Wei,"Lisa is very enthusiasm.  Though the day we arrived she was not at home until night, she prepared every things and the breakfast is very good."

The house is walking distance from shops and restaurants. Getting to and from the freeway is very easy, too. I wish I could have stayed longer!"
796558,31133442,2015-05-02,31441028,Yu,"Burlingame is a very convenient and peaceful town nearby SFO airport. Lisa's house is really sweet and lovely! The room is clean and the bed is so soft. We have a good sleep for our first night is US and woke up with the bird singing. Sometimes there was sound from the train, but we feel OK. "
796558,31249210,2015-05-03,1227701,Lisa,"Very cute house, and comfortable bed in addition to great hospitality. Thanks!"
796558,31481070,2015-05-05,31764622,Rebecca,"Nice safe neighborhood.  Situation was as represented given it was a room rental in an occupied house.  Not recommended for people who aren't comfortable sharing spaces with strangers.  Not a lot of room for extra luggage or to spread out, but that is to be expected when something is described as ""cozy"".  Host was nice about leaving breakfast accessible and provided a bottle of wine and some water.  

"
796558,31725513,2015-05-09,3104359,Linda,"Wow, where do I start?!  I stayed at Lisa's for three nights while I attended a conference near the airport, which was an easy 7 minute drive way.  Lisa felt like a dear friend the minute I met her.  My entire experience there was perfect - Lisa and her daughter, dog and cat were all gracious, the decor delightful, the greeting with snacks and wine, fabulous coffee and breakfast...everything exceeded my expectations.  Coordinating the bathroom time, even with other guests there as well, was easy.  I loved listening to the train chugging away through the open window.  This is a very special place, thanks to all the love Lisa has poured into it."
796558,31950155,2015-05-12,20368336,Krissy,"Lisa was an amazing and gracious host!  The house was great, like a pottery barn doll house.  Wonderful organic breakfast items and welcome basket.  Bed was super comfy.  Location was perfect for walking to downtown as well as the Caltrain - 30 minutes south to Stanford and 30 minutes north to San Francisco.  "
796558,32150433,2015-05-14,32535012,Cheryl,"I can't say enough about our experience with Lisa. Though our booking was last minute, she accommodated us and our stay was magnificent beyond our imagination. The rooms were fabulous and we felt at-home immediately. The coffee cake  met all expectations of ""YUM"" and even took some home to Florida and beat the hunger pains on the flight.  I feel like my daughter and I made a new friend and will definitely keep contact with our host and will come again. Thank you so much for the recommendations on restaurants and shopping in the city. 
In a chilly city, we felt the optimum of WARMTH!!!! the Floridians, Cheryl and Chelsea"
796558,32471356,2015-05-18,7898869,Bailey,Lisa is a warm and friendly host.  Her home is very comfortable and beatiful.
796558,38698027,2015-07-18,9923335,Zicky,Great experience. The room is beautiful and Lisa prepared everything for me when I arrive. She helped me do my laundry and prepare breakfast everyday. Nice place and I definitely recommend it.
796558,39248707,2015-07-21,37524566,Sandeep,"Pleasant stay at Lisa's conveniently located unit not far from SF airport. Cosy bedroom, nice breakfast, good location close to the heart of Burlingame. And Lisa is a wonderful host..."
796558,40087030,2015-07-28,26256814,Leslie,We had an awesome stay with Lisa.  She is a super hostess and made our stay enjoyable and comfortable.  The house is really cool and we loved the dog and cat.  Breakfast was great every morning and we enjoyed sitting out on the back deck when we had time.  The location was perfect for the conference I attended at S. San Fran Conference Center and it was an easy walk to downtown Burlingame for dinner.  We enjoyed walking the neighborhood as well; very quaint little town. We highly recommend this airbnb.
796558,41126883,2015-08-04,37855235,Nicky,"Lisa is a really nice host! My wife and I got a warm welcome from her and the breakfast she provided is really amazing!  Lisa is good at communicating and helpful. We really enjoy the two days' stay there. 
The room is clean and the bed is soft which made us sleep very well. Lisa's house is very lovely with excellent location, 10mins drive from the airport.
Thanks Lisa! Best wishes with you!"
796558,41525893,2015-08-07,35488483,Rita,"Lisa was waiting at the door to welcome me with a smile. She started conversation and put me at ease. My initial impression was that she was very confident and highly organized. She immediately made a connection with me.  She showed me to my room and offered me a nice glass of wine.  In the mornings, she always had a wonderful continental breakfast-the coffee was hot and delicious.  I will come back next time I am in Burlingame.  Thanks Lisa, you are an awesome host in a lovely home you share with guest.

"
796558,41872877,2015-08-09,36575366,Preneshan,Lisa was still awake to welcome us despite our very late arrival at 1am in the morning. The room was comfortable and the location was a 10 minute drive from the airport so very convenient if you need a place close by. The breakfast spread was good. It was much appreciated given the busy morning she had.
796558,42213794,2015-08-11,3618396,Shelby,"
Lisa is a very welcoming, kind and accommodating hostess. Room was small for 2 people, but doable.  Neighborhood and location are perfect and central to Burlingame Ave.  "
796558,42364395,2015-08-12,31763180,Patrick,"Lisa was absolutely wonderful.  You could not find a more pleasant, accommodating host.  Her house is beautiful and the location is fantastic.  She will go out of her way to make you feel at home.  Without question we will always try to stay here first when in the area.  Thanks Lisa."
796558,42438331,2015-08-13,20957622,Natalie,Lisa was by far my favorite Airbnb host that I have ever had. The house was perfect situated in a safe and adorable neighborhood. Walking to lots of restaurants and shops was not even five minutes walk. I always am hesitant about private room searches and this was even better than renting out a whole apartment. Lisa connects with her guests and goes above and beyond to accommodate them. I wish I could of stayed longer to enjoy the breakfast. Can't wait to see you again Lisa!
796558,43295681,2015-08-18,4831584,Benjamin & Elizabeth,"Lisa was very welcoming and friendly. My girlfriend and I enjoyed talking to her and getting her advice on things to do around San Francisco. Lisa's house is conveniently located just blocks away from a nice area with shops, restaurants and a grocery store. "
796558,45012052,2015-08-30,24212320,Jovi,"Lisa is very helpful on everything, the location is good, near downtown, library and Caltrain. The negative side is the house is not comfortable enough to stay, a lot of stuffs in there, the room is very small, even it's hard to move in that room. The bathroom is mass and not clean, it's a bad experience if you want a bath. Also the wifi is very slow to watch any video. So the price is high than it should be. I think $80 is proper price. "
796558,46726580,2015-09-13,23471545,Doris,"We had a very clean, comfortable, relaxing and enjoyable stay here.  The location is easy to find and in a cute neighborhood with lots of good restaurants and shops.  Lisa is very friendly and helpful -- thanks to her, we saved lots of time from driving out to Yosemite and instead chose to explore the city during our brief stay in town before the start of a business trip.  Delicious French pressed coffee to go along with our thoughtfully prepared on-the-go breakfast options.  Highly recommend."
796558,47435912,2015-09-18,24975897,Aravind,Lisa is a very nice host. The room was clean and well kept. 
796558,48005836,2015-09-22,19708246,Paul,"I rented a bedroom at this place for my daughter and her boyfriend when they came to visit. After Justine night, my daughter said it felt like she was staying at a friend's house. In retrospect, she was. Thanks Lisa! See you again soon! "
796558,48951622,2015-09-29,24563396,John,"Lisa is a good host, she is really friendly and kind. Her house is very special and its location is very good. You can walk to those delicious restaurants two blocks away. And her breakfast tasets really good."
796558,49200624,2015-10-02,26846574,Wenxiu,"The host Lisa is so nice. When we stayed in the house, we just feel as same comfortable as in our own home. Lisa prepared planty choices breakfast every morning. Every room decorate a style. I believe Lisa really enjoy live in the life."
796558,49763663,2015-10-06,34861446,Fiona,"As soon as we arrived Lisa made us feel welcome and at home. We loved the heritage style of the cottage with tasteful décor and beautiful artworks. Lisa also provided a wonderful variety of breakfast provisions from fresh fruit, local produce and freshly made coffee and hot chocolate. It was a real treat to have such a choice of delights. Lisa was helpful with arranging transport and advice on places to visit and eat. I loved the atmosphere and warm feel that Lisa has created in this home away from home. Thank you so much and we hope to return one day..."
796558,50347396,2015-10-11,41636882,Kevin,"I very much enjoyed my stay at Lisa's home. Her space was airy and welcoming! Lisa is a wonderful host. She consistently ensured that my stay was going well, that I was comfortable, and that any questions I had were answered or needs were met. Her home is in a great location in close proximity to SF and in short walking distance of coffee shops, restaurants, shops, etc. I will definitely stay with Lisa should I return to the area!"
796558,52201796,2015-10-26,34579107,Rachel,"Lisa was the most incredible host we have ever experienced. I have no words for how elegantly decorated her home was. I felt like I was tucked away in my own little Victorian world for a moment. It was the perfect walking distance from a plethora of shops and restaurants in a very dog-friendly town. 
Our room was perfectly sized for my boyfriend and I as well as our puppy. The bed was incredible, and she even let us use her washer and dryer! 
Burlingame was the perfect distance from SF and Palo Alto for us to enjoy both cities in two days and come home to this B&B. 
Now to the good stuff.... THE FOOD. Each morning we had fresh breakfast/coffee waiting for us downstairs with all sorts of jams/juices. At night we enjoyed a bonfire with some other guests with tapas set out by Lisa, perfectly topping off our time in Burlingame. 
I would 100% recommend this place to my friends and family. You should take it up before someone else does, especially for such a reasonable price! "
796558,52822018,2015-11-02,18388884,W,"This was my second visit. Candles and water awaited me in my room. Delicious breakfast and suggestions that were helpful to my stay, even a shopping trolley to carry all my extras!"
796558,53231644,2015-11-06,47319356,Shuichiro,"It was wonderful experience at Lisa's house. In spite of arriving late at night because of flight delay, Lisa and her dog welcomed me warmly. "
796558,54327771,2015-11-18,46503812,Sarah,"I stayed with Lisa for 10 days when I moved to Burlingame. She was a fantastic host and so kind and welcoming. She had great suggestions about short road trips, thing to do and see and good local restaurants. Every morning she provided a lovely breakfast and made me feel at home. Her adorable house is a very short walk to Burlingame Ave where there is great shopping. Definitely a great location! "
796558,54557661,2015-11-21,9273223,Robin,"Lisa's goes above expectations to make you feel welcome with luxurious amenities and thoughtful touches. Her home is extraordinarily magical and appointed with necessities for the business or vacation traveler. She's an outstanding host who is easygoing, yet highly attentive...she puts the BnB in Airbnb. 

Thank you Lisa! I look forward to returning."
796558,60652693,2016-01-25,2990955,DeBora,"Lisa was a pleasure to have as a host. She made me feel welcome immediately and I just loved the friendly and cozy atmosphere of her home. I confess to being a dog lover and really enjoyed her sweet Julia and the delightful Luna, a visiting rescue dog, who greeted me upon my arrival.  Lisa's house was quiet and comfortable, I slept very well, every night! Being greeted in the morning with her fantastic fresh fruit, cereal, eggs, fresh brewed tea and coffee and fancy delicious breads and muffins for breakfast was the icing on the cake!
I plan to return to her lovely place the next time I am in the area! "
796558,61500822,2016-02-05,52822521,Zhu,great location and great Lisa.we enjoyed this stay very much.the riom is clean and warm.with lovely dogs and cat.and Lisa is so nice.and the brekefast is hughly recommaned.

796558,63761856,2016-02-26,53153011,Terri,"Lisa is the perfect host.  Her house is beautiful, light and airy, modern and upscale with a definite feeling of home.  One will never find a better breakfast with so many choices.  She asked what we liked and had everything plus the next morning!  Her fruits were fresh and perfect, the jams, yogurt, breakfast bars ....and eggs anyway we liked.  She placed so many special things for us  about the house, our room, the bath and the kitchen that it took us a while to take it all in!  everything (especially bed linens) was upscale and clean.  We particularly enjoyed walking around the corner to Burlingame Avenue where there are upscale shops, sidewalk cafes and upscale resturants.  The Caltrain within easy walking distance for trips elsewhere.  My husband and I jogged to a park (Coyote Point) on the San Francisco Bay in the  morning..The view of the Bay and San Francisco skyline were beautiful    We will certainly be going back to Lisa's place.  A great value  that exceeded our expectation.  "
796558,65929316,2016-03-18,46162222,Ann,"If you are looking for that perfect place, walkable to downtown with an awesome breakfast spread and a friendly, gracious host, this is it! Dog included, too. My husband and I stayed for two nights and really felt right at home. Everything listed in the description was spot on, and Lisa was open and approachable. She is also a great resource if you need information about the area. We enjoyed the proximity to downtown Burlingame, shops, restaurants, and the off street parking."

796558,71133085,2016-04-23,2421020,Pieter,"We love Lisa! She is great, and so is her super cute cottage! She made us feel totally at home and the place has a bit of the feel of an actual Bed and Breakfast. Lisa is such a natural host/entertainer, you get the feeling that every little detail has been thought of, and the experience flows smoothly. Dog barked a lot, but settled down after a bit. Overall, a great place to stay near the airport! Also very close to the main drag of Burlingame with all kinds of shops, restaurants. (We ate at the Plant restaurant - food was good, service was iffy!)"
796558,71597881,2016-04-26,52043596,霖,"The owner of the house Lisa is kindly and warm hearted, when I first entered the room which Lisa prepare for us we feel it is livable and comfortable, each morning Lisa prepare a hearty breakfast for us,the three days when we lived at Lisa's home left wonderful memories for me and my wife"

796558,78646458,2016-06-08,512667,Christoffer T,"The stay was so nice and cozy, great breakfast and glowing conversations! Would absolutely go back."
796558,78813656,2016-06-09,66889783,Jesteny-Amber,"This was only our 3rd airbnb and was probably the best one yet on terms of our host. She was very conversational, easy to talk to, super laid back, and great with recommendations. We had to leave super early for a flight in the morning, so we weren't going to be able to eat her hearty breakfast. Instead though, she left us these cute little bags full of fruit and yogurt in the fridge. So thoughtful! Her home was beautiful as well and was only a walk away from the middle of town with all these resaurants. We loved it! Definitely would go back again. "
796558,79338107,2016-06-12,32930844,Phyllis,LISA IS A WONDERFUL HOSTESS AND VERY HELPFUL.  OUR NEGATIVE COMMENTS ARE IN NO WAY REFLECTIVE OF LISA'S HOSPITALITY.
796558,80402325,2016-06-18,70358835,Tanya,"Lisa made the time to make my first experience with Air BnB a remarkable one.  The house was clean, the bed was great and comfortable and Lisa is a great host.  I had no trouble finding a spot to park in front of the house.  I arrived late and she was there to greet me and show me to my room.  I would highly recommend staying with Lisa if you are in the area.  Hugs on the way out.  What more could you ask for?"
796558,81178556,2016-06-21,69133364,Jenifer,"This was our very first Airbnb stay and Lisa has set the bar high! She is so friendly and accommodating, and we were so happy that our first stay was with her. The breakfast spread was delicious (I even found my new favorite kind of yogurt through her!) and really made it feel like home. She had great restaurant & site seeing recommendations and helped us navigate the best way to take public transit into SF. The house was extremely cozy and was the perfect setting to come back to after a long day of sight seeing. The room was calming and the bed was insanely comfortable. We loved waking up to the beautiful California sun streaming into the bedroom! Downtown Burlingame is just a short walk and offers so many great food options as well as cute, local shops. We would definitely stay with Lisa again and recommend it to others as well! "
796558,82745930,2016-06-29,30087064,Takako,Lisa was so welcoming ! Gave me vitamin C when I was really tired from long flight. I had really fun time chatting with Lisa. Oh and breakfast was amazing. The best Airbnb experience ever !

796558,84419654,2016-07-07,6199109,Nathan,"This place is the cutest! We had a great stay here. There are three bedrooms upstairs and only one bath; luckily, we were there when no one else was. The place is very well decorated, like out of a magazine. Lisa puts the B in AirBnB! The breakfast she laid out is absolutely fantastic!!! I was almost late to work because I was enjoying it so much. We had a great stay here, and will definitely recommend it to anyone."
796558,85836190,2016-07-13,67839972,Alec,"Lisa was an attentive, friendly, and personable host. Her attention to detail was phenomenal and the breakfast spread was great. 

There were a few minor issues, but she did everything in her power to correct them, you've just got to let her know what they are.

Personally I was not a fan of the key system, but it seems not to be a problem."
796558,86921730,2016-07-18,4212573,Suzanne,"Lisa made me feel very welcome. The listing is actually better than described because of her attention to the thoughtful details of every thing a guest could want. The location is great, close to cool shops and cafes in Burlingame. Breakfasts were probably the best breakfasts I've had anywhere in the world! Lisa is an extremely kind, caring host and I highly recommend staying with her. "
796558,90086093,2016-07-31,13147663,Vivi,"Lisa is the best host ever!

796558,92273104,2016-08-08,46778801,Anjum,"Lisa was a wonderful host! She has a beautiful home, stocked with all of the things we could possibly need. When we told her that we had a very early flight, Lisa packed a breakfast for us to take with us! Her home is very convenient for the airport, and also a great hub for anyone who wants to stay just outside of San Francisco. Lisa was wonderfully kind and welcoming, and I would absolutely stay with her again."
796558,93376004,2016-08-12,5823997,Reiko,"Lisa's hospitality was perfect for me.
My room was very clean and comfortable.
Bath room was also clean.
the house is very near from downtown,so I could go cafe and Safeway by walk.
And I used Caltrain some times,the Burlingame Station is very near.
Breakfast was amaizing! Bread,egg,fruits and yogurt were so good.I felt happy every morning.
And I love Lisa's cat and dog.They are soooo cute!
I want to go back there if I stay at San Mateo."

796558,94924958,2016-08-17,5823997,Reiko,"週末を挟んで､2度目の滞在でした｡
Lisaはとても親切な明るいﾎｽﾄで､ｺﾐｭﾆｹｰｼｮﾝがとてもｽﾑｰｽﾞでした｡
早めに到着して荷物だけを置かせてもらうことができましたし､ﾁｪｯｸｱｳﾄ後に荷物を置かせてもらい､空港へ向かう直前に荷物を受け取ることもできました｡
家全体がとても清潔でｵｼｬﾚなｲﾝﾃﾘｱで夢のような楽しい時間でした｡毎朝､ﾊﾟﾝやｼﾞｬﾑ､卵やﾖｰｸﾞﾙﾄ､ﾌﾙｰﾂがおしゃれなﾋﾞｭｯﾌｪ形式で置かれており､目にも美しく､幸せな時間でした｡ｺｰﾋｰも入れてくれました｡慌ただしい朝は､朝食をﾗﾝﾁﾎﾞｯｸｽのようにまとめてくれた日もありました｡お洗濯もお願いでき､お母さんのようでした｡
家の場所も最高で､ｶﾙﾄﾚｲﾝから歩いて5分､商店街にも歩いて5分でｶﾌｪやｽｰﾊﾟｰ､ｵｼｬﾚなﾌﾞﾗﾝﾄﾞｼｮｯﾌﾟやﾚｽﾄﾗﾝがたくさん並んでいる観光地のような場所でした｡
私以外に､一部屋貸していて､宿泊しているｶｯﾌﾟﾙや2人組がいましたが､皆さん良い人達で､時々会話して楽しかったです｡
またこのｴﾘｱに来るときは､こちらに泊まりたいです｡"
796558,95392213,2016-08-19,43352712,Christina,Lisa is amazing.  She went above and beyond anything I expected (& that includes the breakfast spread!).  She is a wonderful host and this home is so charming.  She really pays attention to the details & it feels much more like you are at a quaint bed and breakfast than in someone else's home.  Burlingame is a beautiful town / incredibly safe area and this home is centrally located & makes getting around so easy.  Downtown Burlingame is a 3 minute walk away.  Uber in and out of SF will run you ~$26/one way.
796558,96211750,2016-08-22,35314943,Sebastian,Staying at Lisa's place was probably the best airbnb experience I had so far. The house is beautiful and has a great atmosphere. Lisa is a wonderful host and made us feel very welcome even though we arrived pretty late at night. she helped us out with everything we needed during our stay and then there was the awesome breakfast! 
796558,98006966,2016-08-29,4023396,Carolina  Melendez,"This was my best experience using Airbnb. The place was great, even better than expected, the breakfast amazing and Lisa is a wonderful  and lovely person, who definitely knows how to be a great hostess. My friend and I enjoy our stay very much and would highly recommend it. We really hope to go back one day :)"
796558,98925175,2016-09-02,81001755,Zoe,"Right from the start, Lisa made us feel at home. There were fresh-baked cookies awaiting us in our room (along with mints and fluffy bathrobes) and Lisa was right there to answer every question we had. Lisa anticipates your every need---there are extra amenities in the bathroom, water pitchers in the bedrooms, and everything you could want for breakfast, all presented *beautifully.* The beds are oh-so comfy and the breakfast is DELICIOUS. This was by far our best AirBnb experience. We couldn't recommend it highly enough!  "
796558,100023403,2016-09-06,4025258,Francoise,"Notre second arrêt chez Lisa ..
Lisa est une hôtesse particulièrement chaleureuse et accueillante. Maison très agréablement décorée. Beaucoup d'accessoires sont mis à disposition . Le petit déjeuner est fantastique.
Le partage avec d'autres personnes et Lisa a été très agréable pendant ce séjour.
Une adresse à retenir dans une petite ville pleine de charme, connection avec SF facile par le train."

The breakfast was great. And my wife fall in love with otis, her cat."
796558,102288502,2016-09-17,55380038,Hung Chun,"It was my best Airbnb experience to stay at Lisa's house. The house is beautiful, breakfast was good, location is easy to take Cal Train. Also the host Lisa made us feel welcome even we arrived very late because of the flight. I will stay here again come to San Francisco again, and highly recommend to who is searching for a nice Airbnb experience."
796558,102617996,2016-09-18,4775029,Matt,"I really don't understand all of the great reviews for this location.  The room was ok, but no A/C and we had to share a bathroom.  But overall, I'm leaving this bad review because Lisa was just flat out rude and treating us as if we're 10 years old.  I've stayed in many AirBnB's around the world and have never had a problem, until Lisa.  I understand we weren't able to check-in until late (not our fault that it's a 4pm check-in and we were already in the city), and then wanting to kick us out of the place.  Lisa could learn to treat her customers with a little more kindness, especially when they're paying so much to literally use a bedroom for 12 hours.  Oh, side note, Lisa doesn't own this place nor live there, so she's renting and subleasing the joint, probably illegally.  "
796558,103293465,2016-09-21,57574658,Shin,"大変素晴らしいﾎｽﾄとお部屋でした!
海外旅行が初めての娘と二人で､短期間のﾎｰﾑｽﾃｲのつもりでこちらに泊まりました｡
お部屋は写真の通り素敵でｷﾚｲで､さらに家中の小物がとても可愛くて娘が大興奮｡
ｱﾒﾆﾃｨも充実しています｡
また皆さんのﾚﾋﾞｭｰにあるとおり､Lisaお手製の朝食の美味しいこと!
最終日のﾁｪｯｸｱｳﾄについて､午前の便で早く空港に向かうので朝食前に出発すると伝えたところ､なんとLisaが｢空港で食べてね｣と朝食をそれぞれﾊﾞｯｸﾞに詰めて用意してくれました!ｻﾝﾌﾗﾝｼｽｺ国際空港へもとても近く車で10分程度なので､午前のﾌﾗｲﾄの方へもｵｽｽﾒです｡
他のｹﾞｽﾄの方やLisaの旦那さんとのｺﾐｭﾆｹｰｼｮﾝも楽しむことができました｡Burlimgameの街はｵｼｬﾚなお店が多く､ｺﾞﾐひとつ落ちていないとてもｷﾚｲなところで､前日までいたｻﾝﾌﾗﾝｼｽｺ市内に比べてかなり安全なｴﾘｱだと感じました｡
改めてLisa&Benのご夫婦に感謝!
ｻﾝﾌﾗﾝｼｽｺにまた来るときは､ぜひもう一度ここに泊まりたいと思います!
そうだ最後にﾘｽ!
裏庭の木でﾘｽが駆け回ってましたよ^^

Lisa is a great host, and this is a really wonderful place here!
I am very thankful for Lisa's hospitality.
Thank you very much!"
796558,103609041,2016-09-23,22001738,Julie,"Lisa's home is a true Bnb. She and her dog Julia greeted me at her lovely home. The bedroom was stunning, and the bed was super comfortable, as were the linens and pillows. 
     The morning breakfast included poached eggs, all kinds of delicious cake, French press coffee, fresh fruit, different yogurts and jams, fresh juice and I am sure I am forgetting some things.  
     Lisa is a consummate professional in the hospitality business.  The little touches, including a fully stocked bathroom of things one might have forgotten, slippers and a sleep mask, make this place perfect.
  Lisa is a true super host!"

The breakfast is amazing and you get everything. Lisa is a wonderfull host and I definitely come again. Burlingame has a nice main street with a good tea bar. I loved to be there, felt like home!

796558,108309972,2016-10-15,92746379,Xu,"My husband and I stayed at Lisa's place for a quick 2 nights trip in San Francisco. Lisa always made herself available to us, and was very organized. The house itself was beautifully decorated and immaculate. Her dog, Julia, is very adorable! We would definitely stay at Lisa's again, unforgettable memories here. Highly recommend to anyone headed to SF."
796558,109631941,2016-10-22,7032420,Sheree,Great little spot in easy walking distance to Burlingame shopping and train station. Lisa is great host who provides a lovely breakfast. The rooms are cozy with a shared bathroom and everything was clean. Lisa has her dog and cat inside so if you have any allergies maybe keep that in mind when booking. Would definitely recommend this Airbnb. 
796558,112613481,2016-11-06,22875988,Richard,"Staying with Lisa was the the best Airbnb experience me and my wife have had yet. From the time we arrived until the time we left Lisa was friendly, welcoming and super helpful. During our week stay, we chatted a lot with Lisa and had some deeply enlightening conversations.

The house was clean and tidy, exactly as pictured. Plenty of towels, toiletries, and essentials were provided. Lisa provided a delicious daily selection of breakfast options at 8am, and also gave us recommendations for some great food places nearby.

The house itself is located just down the street from the Burlingame Caltrain station (about 5-10 minute walk) and the bustling downtown area (about 3-7 minute walk).

I would recommend this location to anyone looking to stay near San Mateo/Burlingame in a heartbeat. "
796558,114209181,2016-11-16,98985989,David,"This Air B & B is warm, friendly, welcoming, in a nice neighborhood with period furnishings that are wonderful to enjoy during a stay.  The owner is on site and within earshot if a question about the area needs addressing.  This Air B & B is not perfectly quiet, because CalTrain can be heard sounding their horn at nearby street crossings.  There is a wonderful street of shops and restaurants a short stroll away.  This is a fine place to stay."
796558,114471016,2016-11-18,21896733,Chris,Great walkable location. Amazing breakfast that Lisa puts out especially the coffee!

796558,123298234,2016-12-28,4813628,Showchia,"I rented Lisa's place for my daughter and her significant other to stay during our Xmas family reunion.  Lisa is a great hostess and made great breakfast every morning.  She is also very considerate and made every effort to ensure their visit is a pleasant one.  The resident dog Julie was very friendly and adorable according to my daughter who is considering getting a dog of her own.  We live just across the border in San Mateo and are very familiar with the area.  Her place is centrally located, yet quiet safe and tranquil.  My daughter had to go into her Palo Alto branch office to work several mornings; Cal Train was frequent and convenient.  The station is just steps away.  Many excellent restaurants and boutiques are also within very easy walking distance. The location could not have been more ideal for our family get together."
796558,126535786,2017-01-12,14863173,Chris,Lisa prepared a very nice breakfast.  The home was quaint.

Her home, decor and design is amazing. The backyard is an urban treasure. If you're looking for a place in the Burlingame area, stay with Lisa and her sweet pooch Julia! "
796558,142902837,2017-04-09,8220578,Erin,"Lisa (and Julia) are great hosts. If you have a dog and need a place to stay, Lisa's home is a stone's throw from downtown Burlingame, a 15 minute drive to the airport, and a 20 minute drive to the beach and San Francisco."
796558,145302382,2017-04-17,286346,Jessica,"We stayed at Lisa's BnB for over a week and loved it! Here's why:
- We woke up to a delicious breakfast spread everyday. 
- Perfect location if you enjoy walking to coffee shops, restaurants and other retail establishments.
- Accessible to public transportation so going to SF and other Bay Area destinations is super easy
- Uber is not too expensive if you just need to get to your meeting quickly.

The house is decorated in country charm while the backyard is spacious and secure Our dog Beckham enjoyed every minute chasing after squirrels. The neighborhood is super safe, quiet and pleasant. Highly recommend booking this place for your next trip!"

She struck a balance between being available and friendly and giving us our privacy. Our stay felt like a cross between staying with your sister's and a lovely b&b. Breakie was yummy. We loved our time there."

796558,153102513,2017-05-19,50817424,Martin,I stayed with Lisa for 3 nights when I was on a business trip to the Bay area. The house is 100 years old and very picturesque. The room was very clean and the bed super comfy. Lisa is a true service professional who made me feel just as at home. Great breakfast made up every morning with a good selection. I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to get out of the traditional business hotels and see a bit of the area instead. Will be back!
796558,154942216,2017-05-26,103393513,Steve,"Very nice place, central to downtown, the train, highway, and Lisa was great host, very friendly, best breakfasts by far (tea, fruit, breads, jams, juices).  

Place has 2-3 guest rooms and shared bathrooms, but bed and rooms very comfortable, nice linens, 5 min walk to town.


Highly recommend."

796558,158664016,2017-06-07,95786415,Christina,"This was my first time using air Bnb and I could not have had a better experience. I felt like Lisa was my mom away from home, she made suggestions of places to check out, even made me a nail appointment when I expressed I wanted to get my nails done. The room was so cozy, the decorations were suiting to the house. The breakfast every morning was awesome! I have nothing but good things to say about staying at Lisa's, I would come back in a heart beat. "

Till late in the evening we chatted we Lisa about everything, it was very surprising. We sit her lovely kitchen and had a great evening. 

The bedroom was warm and cosy. A giant and soft bed, that was a good sleep!! Like a hotel bed.

Her breakfast was the surprise in the morning. Very good and so much choice. 

It was a great visit and Lisa is really a great host, very friendly and real Guest oriëntated."
796558,160587468,2017-06-14,96822856,Helen,"Lisa is one of the best airbnb hosts I've ever met. The room I stayed at her house is very clean, cozy, and well-decorated with warm welcome of bottle waters, candies and tangerines. Lisa is very thoughtful and detail-minded. I can find everything I need in the bathroom from clean towels to lotion, Q-tips, hairdryer, etc. The breakfast is definitely the highlight of my stay here. I highly recommend Lisa's house to everyone at airbnb communities and I will definitely stay at her house again next time I'm in SF."
796558,160823349,2017-06-15,12931196,Vajra,Lisa is a wonderful host. I felt like part of the family. Highly recommend!
796558,163988470,2017-06-25,88915143,Doug,Rustic yet Wes Anderson type of design. No AC would be the only major amenity missing. The common bathroom products are a very nice touch. Also the breakfast spread is amazing. 
796558,164827041,2017-06-29,102886381,Pierre,"Perfect place to stay for our trip. Lisa is very kind, generous, and friendly. Her house is clean, bright, and cozy with comfy bed and lots of pillows.

We booked last minute and upon arrival our room was impeccable, with sweet touches like a water dish and bone for our dog. The whole home was charming and comfortable. We felt comfortable and welcome the whole stay. A very walkable neighborhood with access to restaurants and shops. 

Lisa is an amazing spirit and we were so happy to have found her. Highly recommend! "
796558,171129430,2017-07-16,128665246,Amelia,"Fantastic, homey place to stay with a hardworking and warm host. It was great having a place so close to a lot of shops, every kind of restaurant you could want, the train to San Fran, a Walgreen's and a Safeway; everything no more than 5 minutes walk.
Attention to detail here was fantastic, and all our needs were met.
A highlight was the fresh, varied spread laid out every day for breakfast.
Comfortable bed and adorable fixtures throughout the house.
Fantastic communication.
We would recommend to friends and stay again."

796558,180572752,2017-08-10,126507534,Gregory,"The price was about the same as a Priceline Express Deal for a 1-2 star motel.  If you prefer a cheap, sterile hotel room in a bad area use Priceline, but if you wish for something with quaint warmth in a spendid neighborhood choose Lisa's home, which is competitively priced.

The room is charming as is the home.  It has a large private back yard if you smoke (I do not).  It's a nice place to just read a book over coffee.

Lisa has provided all manner of shampoos, new tooth brushes, and dozens of convenience items.  The bed is cloud-like.

Her breakfast was a delight, with fresh figs, tangerines, grapes, and other fruits, as well as a selection of fresh-squeezed juices.  Plus, a french press coffee that is perfect.

The home is on a tree-lined street across from the town's landmark library, which has a cafe and open to 9:00 pm.  The next street over has restaurants, bars, and shopping for anyone's tastes, with pleasant sidewalks.

As much as I enjoyed the room, I liked talking with Lisa even more.  She has an interesting story, and I'm sure to stay in touch now and then."

796558,194896120,2017-09-17,103156873,Kathleen,"Delightful and inviting, picture-book house. Down comforters and yummy candy in the room. Splendid yard, like an oasis in the middle of the city. Loved eating my meals out there and watching the squirrels. Just a short walk to the fun shopping street. I will be back."
796558,198858021,2017-09-30,103393513,Steve,"My second time here, and still a great place, just a block from downtown, Caltrain, etc.  Best breakfast of any AirBnB. And Lisa is always super helpful."

796558,206984691,2017-10-27,5952596,Toni,"Lisa bietet in ihrem gemütlichen, hundertjährigen Haus mit fantastischem Frühstück eine wohltuende Atmosphäre. Die Lage ist hervorragend: Einzelhausbebauung ringsherum, fußläufig ein sehr gepflegtes Stadtzenrum mit diversen Cafes und Restaurants und ein öffentlich zugängliches Leichtathletikstadion für den sportlichen Ausgleich. Die Nähe zur Bahnstation Burlingame (400m) ermöglicht die schnelle Verbindung mit dem Caltrain nach Norden ( San Francisco) und nach Süden (Palo Alto/ Stanford/ Silicon Valley)."
796558,208525486,2017-11-01,58462977,Jack,"I’m almost inclined NOT to write a review because I don’t want the secret to get out on how amazing this air bnb was. Lisa is one of the best hosts, and her home was just outstanding. Every last detail was so well thought out and the experience was delightful. It’s the type of place I looked forward to come “home” to after work. It truly did feel like a home. Thanks Lisa! Bravo   "
796558,210315980,2017-11-08,42823594,Etienne,"The place is really nice, and Lisa was absolutely charming. Special mention to the delicious breakfast which included a surprising raspberry habanero yoghurt."
796558,210499030,2017-11-09,30229419,Teresita,"Such a lovely space! Lisa was a kind and attentive host with a lovely home. 

I didn't know what to expect. I just needed a place to crash for the night because construction halted water & power in my home. I had never experienced an airbnb stay & only signed on because hotels were outrageously priced due to major convention in our area. I found Lisa's place at a reasonable price, it looked nice online, reviews were good, she's dog friendly... sold! 

I arrived with my dog after a long day at work to a warm & dog friendly welcome from Lisa and her pup. Dog owners know what a relief that is. Lisa had my name on the door, a robe and slippers waiting for me, gummy treats with our initials, a dog bed & water bowl with dog treats on the side. Who knew I was in for a mini vacay?? 

The home is beautiful & artfully decorated. The yard was secure and dog friendly too. Though I live in the area, I hope to stay there again when I need a mini retreat. Might even plan a stay for my birthday & schedule a spa day on the avenue. Couldn't be more perfect! Whether your traveling for work, for fun, or just need a place for the night like me, no doubt you'll feel as comfortable and pampered as I did. Enjoy it!"
796558,212018918,2017-11-15,158708574,Stephen,"Close to the airport and walkable to the many great restaurants and bars in Burlingame.

796558,220531385,2017-12-22,73593078,Candace,Lisa's place far surpassed what I was expecting. Right from the beginning when I enquired about a few things she was quick to reply and help answer any questions I had. Upon arrival she was the most amazing host that anyone could ever ask for. Super friendly and willing to make you feel like you're at your own home. I'd recommend staying with Lisa if you're ever in the Bay area.
796558,224319255,2018-01-02,13560207,Randy,"Cozy and warm, in deed, the home gives a warm country cottage appearance from the decor. Be aware of the noise level. Lisa has 2 mature dogs when bark in tandem this becomes very loud."
796558,226085846,2018-01-08,120964180,Daniel,She’s really sweet and has adorable dogs!

796558,243340094,2018-03-15,175775281,Amannda,"Lisa truly went above and beyond for me as a first time lone traveller and airbnb'er. I cannot praise Lisa enough for being so accommodating to my needs as a young female, her touches of homely hospitality had me feeling as close to home as possible. She is a wonderfully kind hearted women who I would recommend to all who in search of a comfortable place to rest and additionally wake to a really yummy breakfast spread!"

796558,249119998,2018-04-01,66336386,Lydia,"Lisa is good at room design, and that’s why her house is beautifully designed, with an antique, collective style. She is also strict in rules and cleanliness, and therefore the house is extraordinarily tidy and treated well. The breakfast is delicious and delicate as in good restaurants. Her doggie barks to protect the house but is very friendly. Overall, our stay was fantastic and Lisa is the most interesting person we met during this trip."
796558,250955589,2018-04-06,26034363,Jay,"I’d like to say that my second stay at Lisa’s place was a terrible experience. 
1. The rooms have no sound proof, and you can hear noises in the morning and after going sleep;
2. Not convenient for shower, need to wait in line in the morning for showers, especially when all rooms are full;
3. Host not considerate of the guests who are afraid of dogs;
4. Parking is really inconvenient, single driveway and narrow exit onto the road;
5. She explicitly mentioned to the guest that the guest can only access his own room and the bathroom."
796558,252945561,2018-04-12,2199651,Arthur,"Lisa was a great host. Her home is clean, comfortable, incredibly charming, and the check in / check out couldn’t be simpler. Great value for the area.  Highly recommend Lisa’s place."

796558,307138043,2018-08-13,116091311,Aj,"This home is beyond cute. The personal touches were everywhere and you get an instant sense of comfort and safety when you walk in. I stayed in one of 3 bedrooms on the second floor with a shared bathroom. Lisa made sure everything was covered - a big bed with plenty of pillows and the most comfortable linens, great lighting, TV, extra toiletries and an overstock of towels in the bathroom. It's pretty perfect. And as a host, Lisa is a sweetheart, a Mom-away-from-home :) This space comes highly recommended. "

Her home is charming,  comfortably homey, and conveniently located to SFO airport, Caltrain and BART, so you don't really need a car to get around. Downtown Burlingame is walking distance with its collection of coffee shops and retailers, along with plenty of food and drink options. I highly recommend Lisa's hospitality and her unique home for something different than a hotel."

I loved the house and Burlingame and would very happily recommend anyone to stay there for a true American feeling. Restaurants and stores suggested were great too. Thanks very much Lisa.
796558,455456674,2019-05-19,1416984,Dorian,"Lisa’s place was great. Super clean, pretty yard (gated for my pup), loads of nice little touches for toiletries and whatnot. Felt very safe in a new neighborhood, where the house was a standout. Not much to do at night in the area but great for a quiet getaway! And close enough to San Fran for evening outings."
796558,456539041,2019-05-21,54908002,Olivia,"Lisa was so communicative and prompt when I contacted her at 9pm one night before my brother landed in SFO. I asked if it was too last minute for her but she quickly responded saying she didn’t mind at all! She sent me detailed instructions to send to him. 

My brother said she was so nice and even waited up for his arrival. He enjoyed the breakfast, cleanliness and comfort of his space. 

I highly recommend booking with Lisa! She was awesome and her place is a gem."
796558,456903060,2019-05-22,33455159,Clayton,Lisa was extremely hospitable. She is why AirBnb was invented. I mean why stay in some drab hotel for a million dollars when you can stay in a fantastic place like Lisa's home.
796558,457289102,2019-05-23,65666441,Deena,"Great place, conveniently located with a great host!"
796558,459687396,2019-05-27,122909839,Rocio,"Lisa's hosting is the very definition of above and beyond. She took the time every morning to prepare breakfast, she made sure to greet us, that we knew the area, and took time out of her day to talk to my boyfriend and me. The amenities were fantastic, and she seemed prepared for anything! We loved meeting Julia, her dog, who can't resist a good pet. You also get a prime location here, close to multiple convention centers as well as the airport. The room itself was spacious, the temperature nice, and the bed comfy! Thank you again Lisa, and many pets to Julia from us!"

1126135,6068521,2013-07-29,6118526,Revant,"I cannot begin to express how glad I am that I chose to live at HackerHome for the summer. I met some amazing people, stayed in a really cool, clean and well-supplied house AND it was cheaper than most other available living options in the bay area.
Vic is a great host and the house is really well maintained. I stayed here for a full two and a half months and had absolutely zero cause for complaint that entire time.
Keep up the great work guys!!
5/5! :)"
1126135,6186819,2013-08-02,3447687,Gregory,"
The host: Vic was super responsive and very accommodating to my schedule and needs. 

The space: Unfortunately, the space was a bit of a mess when I arrived. The sink was filled with dirty dishes; the main room was really no better with some dirty dishes and random stuff around. The sleeping rooms are packed with 2-3 bunk beds each. Expect close sleeping quarters.

Overall: You get what you pay for. The space is perfect for a single male working in the tech industry looking to save some cash. Not recommended for females or anyone adverse to living in a college-style environment. Unfortunately it was not a good fit for me, but others may be more flexible."
1126135,6797022,2013-08-25,6412356,Sher,"Fantastic experience at the HackerHome hosted by Vic.  Although I didn't get a chance to meet him, he was super communicative and responsive before, during, and after my one-week stay.  It was a temporary stay until I found permanent housing in the area.

As for the house, it's a beautiful home with many areas to study and  work.  There is a washer/dryer and WiFi printer that was extremely helpful during my stay.  Even with multiple guests sharing bathrooms, with people coming in and out of the home, with people cooking in the kitchen, everyone was very respectful of each other.

The best part was it gave me, an introvert, an opportunity to meet and get to know other tech/startup people.  "
1126135,8330709,2013-10-26,4860200,Vazgen,"I stayed in hackerhome about a month and I really like it. House is  comfortable, in a quite neighbourhood. Also I met many interesting people from all around the world. "
1126135,9322397,2013-12-21,10411275,Shino,Place is comfortable to stay both for long and short term. It has been kept neat and there were several interesting event held by host. Host is friendly and very nice person. I am sure I would love to repeat to use here when I visit again. 
1126135,15239008,2014-07-05,10849142,Brandon,Great communication. Nice place and helpful people staying there. Was perfect for my interview week. Thanks Vic!
1126135,27517057,2015-03-06,20084929,Raymond,"Vic and the hacker house is a great experience that I cannot say more because the choice words I use arent enough to describe the friends and people you will make and meet learning from other guests seeing their path, chatting over dinner or connecting in some simple way. I felt those experiences are worth more weight in gold.

The house in Millbrae is very nice, everything you need if its too hot or too cold we have AC.....unlike other Airbnb places I've visited the kitchen with a full range of utensils and cookware at your disposal is very convenient. 

There is just enough space for all the guests in the house which is a very nice setting of couches, huge tables to accommodate any task be it work on my college homework or allow otherss to brainstorm ideas for their fields of work.

Having two bathrooms with showers and sinks are another excellent plus you never see both occupied which helps alot with having other roommates combined with varies schedules.

The local restaurants and amenities near by are quite literally different and new but pleasant, their is a post office, a safeway, a bank of america with the BART being a 4 minute walk ...also if note the caltrain/bart has an extensive buss line that connects those into or out of the bay area need a 30 bart ride into SF easy, need a 40 minute train ride into San jose easy.

Great weather even in the winter, can't complain, there are so much more too add. But again Vic does a fantastic job or responding to mishaps or problems that occur in the house, quickly address any issues and constantly takes in advice or feed back on ways to improve the house here in Milbrae a 5* (stars) host to say the least.

I highly recommend the place for those travelers passing through or short term stay tenants/guests."
1126135,27903370,2015-03-14,23681536,Monica,"The apartment is amazing. Vic responds quickly to my message and has clean maid here frequently. You can find anything you want here: kitchen full of all kinds of food and alliance, living room with magazines and tv, well-selected bath room products, a printer and, of course, fun friends from Vic's group! Additionally, the Millbrae neighborhood is one of the best in Bay Area. I will choose here next time i visit the Bay Area. Thank you Vic!"
1126135,28677072,2015-03-28,18752250,Ainsley,"Awesome! This place felt like home and Vic was always available, super helpful and he even dropped in to see if we needed anything. 

We also enjoyed the little secret snack deliveries on our doorstep each week.

Loved the house, nice furniture & floorboards - very modern.

Thanks Vic! If I get to San Francisco again this will be home again :)"
1126135,32422214,2015-05-17,8786341,Renaud,"Un logement collectif bien conçu, bien organisé et confortable à 8 minutes à pied du Calltrain. Petit mot d'accueil, serviettes, machine à laver, Wifi... tout le nécessaire est à disposition pour un tarif raisonnable pour le secteur. Une bonne expérience."
1126135,32946014,2015-05-23,20577993,Henry,"Vic was very responsive with his messages/texts and his house was great. It was modern, had a community of ""hackers"" and in an excellent location -- five minute walk to Trader Joe's, Safeway, restaurants and shops and a ten minute walk to the CalTrain or Bart. I recommend this place."
1126135,33827820,2015-06-01,31680385,James,"Had a great time, really great place with amazing people and a fantastic location. Good if you want to travel to SF & to Palo Alto! 
Will book again! "
1126135,41703710,2015-08-08,3714408,Meagan,"Although I didn't see Vic in person, he was very easy to communicate with. With any questions he is very prompt in getting back to you, and he is very informative in terms of advice of the area. Millbrae is a very nice suburb, and in between house facilities and the neighborhood you have everything you need. The local shopping strip is pretty much on the next block with heaps of grocery stores, Walgreens, Safeway, Starbucks etc...and the library is also down the road. The location is also very close to the airport/BART and is affordable (hence how I ended up there).
The room itself is a dorm you share with 5 others, but the people are really nice and the place is secure. The rooms are also single-sex. 
Vic's place is a very communal and friendly place and I had a great time meeting new people and hearing their stories! "
1126135,43301296,2015-08-18,29692487,Thanasi,"Everything! The place was clean, awesome. Vic is just such a chill guy. I'm calling this place again when I come back. I wish I could've stayed longer!"
1126135,56077188,2015-12-08,46238683,Max,Great experience
1126135,83499259,2016-07-03,10923799,Michele,"I relocated from Indiana to the Bay Area for a new job, and didn't have time to search for a permanent place. So, I stayed in the Millbrae hacker house for 1 1/2 months.

The house was pretty packed with college interns/other random people. I was in the girls room (room 3) for the majority of my stay, and also stayed in a private room (room 6) for a couple of nights.

I met some really interesting people here, and even with people constantly in and out all the time, nothing was stolen. The house manager, Shub, was also really nice and I enjoyed getting to know him. 

So.. why am I giving this house only two stars? 

The biggest reason is that for the price, it's a complete rip-off. I paid $1,380 for a month here, and stayed in a bunk bed in a small room with 5 other girls. Did I mention there's also no closet in the room?? Yeah..

There are also only two (extremely dirty) bathrooms in the house that are accessible from the hallway. Maids are 'supposed to come every Tuesday', but room 3 was only vacuumed one time throughout my entire stay. As you can imagine, the room was pretty gross. There were spiders and spider webs everywhere, the room was jam-packed with stuff (being as girls have a lot of clothes), and it was hot. Sooo, so hot, as there's no a/c in the house. The thermostat registered over 85F most days.

The bathrooms were the worst part. There are two in the hallway, one of which is extremely small. Neither of the bathrooms have windows or fans, so they're both hot all the time. Trash cans are always filled, clumps of hair are left in the drains. Besides the water pressure being horrible, the water temp is constantly fluctuating between burning hot and ice cold. The floors are also constantly soaked with water, and the mats outside of the showers are always wet and dirty. It's impossible to get a good shower here.

Few people actually used the kitchen for cooking. The fridges were always completely stuffed. The kitchen has a small washer in it, and leads to the super creepy basement! Strangely, the basement is where the filled trash bags go- as you can imagine, it's smelly, filled with tons of junk/trash, and overall, pretty disgusting. I had to go down there to do laundry and get mail once, and will never go back again. The basement has a working washing machine, but the dryer doesn't actually dry clothes. The laundry room has a broken washing machine and a dryer (that works) but is nestled under a counter top -- so you have to squat to put your clothes in and take them out. 

Overall, I feel like the owner is taking advantage of foreign kids coming to the states for internships. The house is nothing like the photos. I would not recommend this place for even a short stay."
1126135,89896630,2016-07-30,11555371,Sandia,Great place to crash while looking for a permanent place in the area and opportunity to meet other people working/staying temporarily in the area (as long as you're okay with sharing a room and bathrooms!). Very convenient to Milbrae BART/Caltrain and various grocery stores and restaurants.
1126135,102927910,2016-09-19,18854595,Shannon,"I had a great time at Vic's place. It was comfortable and spacious in a great location for any visitor. Both Vic and the other guests were extremely welcoming and there was always something happening. Even though the house was full when I was there, we made it work with no issues despite our own busy schedules! The house BBQ was especially a nice touch!"
1126135,114613698,2016-11-19,33566319,Jaween,"I had a lovely time here for three months. The house was nice and spacious. Even though there was space for six people in the room, there were usually only one or two others staying in my room (I came to the house during the late summer and through the fall). 

The other guests I met were great people. Shub, the house maintainer, is a great guy. and was swift in addressing any issues that came up and was 

The location is extremely convenient since it's close to grocery stores and public transport (Caltrain, BART and samTrans buses). And it's pretty well priced. 

Highly impressed by this place. "
1126135,134890826,2017-03-01,63385364,Yasmine,"Overall great place, met many wonderful people I will stay in touch with. Shut does a great job of making you feel welcome and creating little events like yoga, insanity working outs,  movie nights and household dinners to get everyone together. Great vibes, awesome safe location close to everything you want and need!"
1126135,138669956,2017-03-20,121178686,Garrick,Great experience.  Everyone open and accepting of everyone else in the house! I was about to reschedule and leave early because my business was done but was glad I stayed as I enjoyed the trip like I would not have if I would have stayed at a boring hotel.  Thanks to everyone in the house who turned this into a mini vacation for me!
1126135,163438916,2017-06-24,103890190,Emmanuel,Nice place in a convenient location. 
1126135,189109522,2017-08-31,81017783,Roy,Had a great stay. Everyone was very kind and welcoming. It is also just a couple minute walk to the Bart so you can get into downtown within the hour!

1126135,426693134,2019-03-21,93664141,Akira,"This is a great place to stay if you need to be close to the airport and are just staying for a night or two.  It’s 2 miles from the airport and is like a crashpad.  The female room had 3 bunk beds and could accommodate 6 people.  There was plenty of closet space and the drawers were labeled, so everyone had a designated area to store clothing and belongings. The location was walking distance to sooo many restaurants and little shops! I loved it.  Vic was very responsive and helpful. I was able to access the home with no issues and everyone was so nice and welcoming.  I would recommend Vic’s place to others like me, who need a place to crash by the airport. It was exactly what i needed :-)"
1157718,6456240,2013-08-13,6116084,Scott,"Vic was an amazing host! I stayed there for 3 months during my internship. The location was great - very short walk or bike ride to caltrain (and san mateo caltrain is a main one, too). Vic provided all the basics such as sheets, tooth brushes, shampoo, towels, and more. Foods such as cereals, easy dinners, snacks and other breakfast foods are provided. We had at least 5 ""family dinners"" where Vic would come and cook us something tasty. The house itself is very nice. It is a very modern looking house and very spacious. I always had somewhere to sit. The Wifi was a little iffy at first but once brought to Vic's attention he got in touch with comcast and replaced the router with a new one and since then it was blazing fast. With three bathrooms, each with a shower, I never had to wait in the mornings. There was plenty of closet space to keep my things. There is also a garage where I can safely put my bike, which was great. Vic also had some bikes there for use. It was also interesting to meet all the different people who stayed there. I met other interns, founders, and people from all over the world. Overall staying at Vic's hacker home was a great experience and I would go back again. It was nice not having to worry about finding an apartment for 3 months and dealing with furniture, utilities, and going out to buy all the small things necessary to live that Vic provides for free. Thanks Vic!"
1157718,8839326,2013-11-20,9711595,Yuk,"San Mateo hackerhome is awesome.  Host is very kind, helpful and considerate.  I love the hackerhome mate there, all are fun and cool guys.

1157718,26082702,2015-02-02,2212515,Tiff,Vic is an absolute awesome host. The place was amazing. I was the only female staying at this place and Vic kindly upgraded me to a private room. Millbrae is a great location too. Very close to the Caltrain and great coffee shops/Wholefoods/Trader Joes in Millbrea. Will be staying here again. Thanks Vic! 
1157718,26367491,2015-02-10,26357146,Tom,"Vic is very hospital host and he helped us resolved many issues during the period. The house is very clean, well-organized and comfortable in living there. The location is so convenient: Safeway, Caltrain, BART are walking distance within 10 minutes. Not to mention there are many delicious restaurants nearby. I would definitely visit here again!"

1157718,27517951,2015-03-06,26901726,Catherine,"It was a very good experience staying at the Hack House in Millbrae, Vic is very friendly, all the roommates are pleasant and considerate, I really enjoyed. Especially after my initial hesitation that how well I would be able to take it after so many years of staying in FiveStar hotels as an executive of large corporation, now to share a room with someone else. Eventually leant that Vic does great job screening to make sure that people staying there are the right crowd. I will stay there again in the future."
1157718,29969238,2015-04-15,26210772,Thomas,"I'd didn't saw Vic but he always replied quickly to my messages, and we was also very understanding. The house is great, well equipped, lot of space in the living room, nothing to complain about!

The fact that it's a shared room has pros and cons of course. For me, the experience was good and I had pretty respectful roommates during my stay."
1157718,31085238,2015-05-01,4958507,Markus,"Good location,  close to the airport. Great value.  Nice people. You have to walk a little to find parking that is not 2h limited."

"
1157718,43588754,2015-08-20,33499731,Rob,"Vic means well but it was kinda chaotic and had miscommunicated a couple times. The place is kinda overrun and honestly pricey considering the rooms are filled with bunk beds, hard to sleep with so many people on different schedules but it is a share community place after all. Bathroom could be cleaner. Beds aren't that great either. Not the worst but I'd pass and spend $20 more a day for a better experience next time."

1157718,77484854,2016-06-01,28549680,Jon,Vic was great. VERY responsive and friendly. This place is in a great location. 10 minute walk to the Caltrain (Bullet train stop!) and BART station so it's very convenient getting up and down the peninsula or to SFO airport. There's lots of restaurants and grocery store options close by but it's not a noisy area. Diverse group of people living here so there's never a shortage of people to talk to or interesting stories to hear. Loved it.
1157718,80968437,2016-06-20,67884322,Viktor,"Place is great, neighborhood nice (groceries, Irish pub nearby), apartment mates both both cool and kind. Cannot say a bad word. "

1157718,87698424,2016-07-21,80964282,Matthew,"Vic (our host) and Shub (his house manager) were incredible. They were both warm, hospitable, and incredibly communicative. Particularly Vic, who was in touch with me prior to my official booking, all the way through the trip. He even offered us a free upgrade to a studio, though we had to decline for personal reasons. 

I enjoyed our stay, the house is in a very convenient area. The BART was a close walk, as well as shops and restaurants. We were able to take the BART to San Francisco with ease, as well as Berkley. The airport is accessible through BART, though the house is only about a ten minute drive. 

Shub was nice, laid-back, great to speak to, checked on us, and offered us food as well! 

Great stay, if you need a place to sleep in this area, definitely give Vic and Shub (or one of Vic's other properties) a try. Affordable as well. "
1157718,89040892,2016-07-26,81555074,Jed,"Vic was amazing since Day 1! He worked with us on price to fit our budget especially for our length of stay! Any concern that we brought up during our stay, it was immediately addressed and fixed! Vic was a great host and he made our stay very comfortable!"

Everyone was respectful and quiet. The bed was so so so comfortable! The bathroom was so clean and that is a huge deal for me. 

I made a new friend and great networking contact. 

Seriously you should stay in this place."

I ate dinner outside every night because the kitchen was totally dirty, with dishes unwashed for 24hs+. A smell in the house will make you want to spent the most of your time outside the house. I do not recommend this house; I have pictures if anyone would like to see the reallity; because it´s not as described in the pictures published."

I was visiting Stanford for the month and had a crazy schedule, and coming home to a community of creative, fun, responsible people really made my experience so much better! They were both fantastic hosts, and I hope to be connected to them in the future. I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone I know."

Vic and Vinh are great hosts who are very accommodating and will go out of their way to make your stay as comfortable as possible. They will occasionally throw a social event and invite the other residents from the HackerHome network. They are also great at helping find people to network with especially if you're into startups."
1334378,14347225,2014-06-17,5434369,Bryan,"Vic and Vinh are both really chill and nice people. To give a visual - they both host dinners and play basketball with the house residents. The house itself may feel a bit cramped, depending on what time of year you're there. A lot of summer interns reside during the summer, so bedrooms are always filled to capacity. House itself has a ping pong table/full kitchen/TV, so it's pretty comfortable, but it's tough to feel ""at home"" with the sheer number of guests there. You do meet some cool people, so it's a nice place first place to stay in the MP/Palo Alto area."
1334378,16214465,2014-07-23,13131947,Quentin,"I never met Vic but the place is great. Very clean, everything I needed was there. Everyone is very focused on programming which makes this a great ""Hacker Home""."
1334378,16840471,2014-08-03,8949593,Federica,"I've been in hackerhome in Menlo Park for one week. The place was nice, close to the caltrain and to shops. There were a lot of guys from all over the world and the atmosphere was nice and dinamic. When i arrived, i find a message from the host, and i've adored it. "
1334378,17318880,2014-08-10,1104165,Daniel,"Everyone is very nice at the hacker house and there's always someone  around (usually with a laptop). The space can feel a bit cramped sometimes which is obviously par for the course for a place like this, but it's very clean and seems quite well-organized. My recommendations!"
1334378,17886324,2014-08-18,14492447,Maximilian,We had a great time at Vic's place. Safe and clean and full of Silicon Valley Spirit. We even got to use two completely new bikes.
1334378,19650760,2014-09-15,16258444,Rowland,Everything was awesome! The bike made my life so much easier. I will be staying here again.
1334378,20796038,2014-10-05,13845416,Zain,"The neighborhood is great! Very convenient. I only got to meet Vic once in person he was so friendly and he's been super helpful over all. The photos do make it seem more spacious than it actually is but no biggy. Keep in mind in terms of space, there usually are lots of people and work space is available but little personal space but that's a choice one makes when stay in a shared space. It's nice to have people around:)"
1334378,21548248,2014-10-19,22182516,Stephan,"Very pleasant stay in a considerate  environment.  Great start for my stay in California. 
"
1334378,22160045,2014-10-31,21095407,Mikkel,"I did not meet Vic, but the other visitors and especially Adam made me feel very welcome. HackerHome was a very interesting place to stay - not least because most people staying there were working on exiting projects.

I had not expected an 8-bed bedroom, but it worked out great, since everyone was very considerate."
1334378,23302779,2014-11-28,21114713,Yoshio,"I had a great time at Hacker House in Menlo Park.

Vic recommended me two place of Vic's place.

I was grateful because I made a lot of friends at Hacker house where Vic recommended.

In addition, when I arrived Hacker house, Vic came to see.

Thank you Vic.

I will visit Vic's place."
1334378,28460514,2015-03-24,22541285,Gerard,"AWESOME EXPERIENCE
I have no words to describe the experience. I stayed for 3 months in the HackerHome house and it has been one of the most amazing experiences I've ever enjoyed. I don't think it would have been this way should I have chosen another option. 

COOL ENVIRONMENT
The environment is simply fantastic. I got to meet +50 people that were either launching their startups, or studying at Stanford, or working at top companies in the Bay Area. Profiles were diverse and extraordinary, conversations were enriching. Barbecues in the evening, sports in the weekend (running, football, basquetball), surf in Santa Cruz... Vic, Vinh and Adam have built something unique. 

HOUSE ITSELF
I needed a bike during my stay and used them on daily basis and Vinh provided me free assistance immediately when I had some technical problems with one of the bikes during my stay. Things with the shower (3 bathrooms for guys), kitchen and laundry work perfectly smooth. There's an efficient cleaning service and everything is in order in that sense. 

People told me I was crazy about going for 3 months in a shared house. I can't describe their faces when I said I was actually sharing a room. 3 months later, I would do it again without doubts! 

LOCATION
Safeway (big supermarket) at a 5-7 minute walking distance. Same for Caltrain (public transportation). Starbucks around the corner. Actually, you don't need a car if you live here (which is strange for Menlo Park, where everyone uses one). The location is simply great.

OVERALL...
I can only strongly recommend it to other potential guests visiting the Bay Area, be it for 1 week or 3 months. You will 100% enjoy the experience :-)"
1334378,29017007,2015-04-02,28640528,Oscar,Great atmosphere and nice people! 
1334378,30728000,2015-04-26,426689,Erez,"I had stayed a week at hacker home, Vic was very responsive and find me a place in a short rime and also assist me to enter smoothly altho i arrived at midnight.
The house has good atmosphere and ice interaction between  the guests.
The maintenance and cleaning can be better, and also I would expect some simple coffee and tea  to be available.  Its god for the price and the location is great, near the train and near palo alto.
Parking was great !

1334378,31577028,2015-05-07,107743,Yumiko,"My stay was wonderful.  Housemates respected each other and the local manager was so helpful.  Everyone did not hesitate to take extra
miles to help others, which was amazing.  They also had some fun together."
1334378,32409227,2015-05-17,3790857,Rebekah,"HackerHome was wonderful!  Everyone who stayed there was interesting to talk to and super nice.  I actually never got to meet Vic in person, but felt totally taken care of (he checked in throughout the week, arranged for a repairman promptly when plumbing needed to be fixed, etc.)  The HackerHome is itself is a great community, and in a great location in Menlo park.  You can walk to Stanford or anywhere downtown in minutes.  Highly recommended!  "
1334378,45204823,2015-08-31,31274617,Haitham,Great place. The people living here are awesome. Recommend if you're looking for a cheaper place to stay while meeting a bunch of people!
1334378,63577877,2016-02-24,41376954,James,"Highly recommend! 

Had a great time in this comfy house while interacting with an intelligent, international makeup of guests. It's convenient to the Caltrain which was a clean and reliable transit option to San Jose, Silicon Valley, and San Francisco. 

If you're looking for a nice HackerHome, give this one a try!"
1334378,72444303,2016-05-02,38950238,Pablo,"This place is the perfect house for a person working in the Peninsula to stay. I had a seven week contract to fulfill and the house had all the amenities and in close vicinity of any service I needed. I would recommend it for a person in a similar situation as I was, because I was content with the whole experience. "
1334378,87662378,2016-07-21,18468543,Roman,"Cool please for those, who looking for new friends. Best location to live without car."
1334378,105697294,2016-10-02,96811464,Moshi,I planned to stay for just two days but ended up being there for over a week. Vic was very helpful and flexible for my extension of the stay. 
1334378,133784987,2017-02-24,60211904,Espy,"Fell in love with the HH! Great people, great space, great location! I will be back :) Omar, the house manager was super smart & super warm. I made a lot great connections - both personally & professionally. "

1334378,169221239,2017-07-11,24386536,Jordan,Great experience. It was my first time in Silicon Valley and I think this was the right way to do it.
1334378,189740840,2017-09-02,145422726,Vicente,Very nice and quiet place.

1334378,195546942,2017-09-19,147766099,Pol,"Really chill and safe neighborhood, nice house, amazing location (5 minutes walking from Caltrain Menlo Park Station) and the most important, great people.

If you are looking for a place to stay in Sillicon Valley and you don't mind living with probably some of the brightest youngsters you'll ever share room with, definitely it's your place."
1334378,223803475,2018-01-01,33672517,Kéf,"I stayed at the Menlo Park HackerHome over Christmas holidays, and the house was not so busy.  Of 18 beds, only 4-5 were filled.  The place is very conveniently located in Silicon Valley and it's easy to walk (or $3-5 Uber) to Palo Alto or Stanford.  I got to meet Vic when he hosted a Christmas dinner party at the house.  He is one of the most friendly, kind and generous people I have met.  I would definitely stay at this place again and I look forward to coming back again."
1334378,234951889,2018-02-14,103134889,Héctor,Great place. Bed and pillow was great. There is a bit of light entering from the garden is a little bit ann
1334378,237359542,2018-02-22,36696615,Johannes,Great place to stay if you visit Stanford University. Met many awesome people in the house.
1334378,239219305,2018-02-28,15438871,Andrea,"I stayed at the HackerHome of Vic for 5 days  and I certainly recommend this place for short or long stays. You'll feel part of a true family, meeting people from around the word with incredible stories.

It is located in a really good position for Stanford (10-15 minutes by bike) and close to supermarkets and bars. It is also clean and well organized."
1334378,241095668,2018-03-07,108348903,Santiago,"Vic was a great host. From receiving me with a personalized card, to suggesting very cool events in the area, Vic made sure I had a great time during my whole stay. The place is a hostel-like house where many entrepreneurs visiting Sillicon Valley choose to stay. Therefore, exciting conversations are happening and nice and interesting people are all over the place. Great way to get inmersed in the Sillicon Valley!"
1334378,242412818,2018-03-11,14625810,Andrei,The house was nice. Had everything you might need. The host was friendly and welcoming and the other guests were super nice and fun. It's a great place to stay if you have things to do in Palo Alto and around and you can get to downtown San Francisco in about an hour.
1334378,242891865,2018-03-13,47643774,Sebastian,Sieht leider nicht wie auf den Bildern aus. Sehr dunkel und viele Sachen liegen überall herum. Sauberkeit ist ausbaufähig. Nette Gäste und freundliche Begrüßung.
1334378,246078267,2018-03-24,174577359,Maria,"Very cool atmosphere, warm, helpful people. The place is well organized: access to towels, fresh linens, washing machine and coffee machine. Good location. The place is a little bit like a dormitory."
1334378,282948384,2018-06-28,106303151,Charles,"Awesome place, had a fun time here. The housemates are very warm and welcoming, and Vic always arranges events for all the guests to hang out and chill. Would stay again!"
1334378,323080653,2018-09-14,7025916,Josie,"This is a really special place. As expected, it is full of interesting, smart and talented young people who are in the area for a variety of reasons. I loved the community that Vic built and there are many opportunities to socialize with your housemates and residents of other houses. The bunk bed and common space situation is as described - it feels very lived in and homey. It is closer to a house with lots of roommates rather than a pristine, ikea-filled AirBnB rental. The girls room had 6 bunks and mine was in an alcove that felt private (there were max 3 girls during my stay). Noise was never an issue. The backyard and garage office were magical. Walkable distance to trader Joes, cafes, transit and short drive to Stanford was key. Highly recommend for anyone on a budget who is OK with roommates and interested in meeting new people (though there is lots of opportunity for quiet time)!"
1334378,325443905,2018-09-19,38557137,Harrison,The hacker house is a place with great community. come here and meet super smart people from all over the world. share your ideas and build on others.  the kitchen is easy to use and so is the three bathrooms.  I recommend this one to anyone!
1334378,343776599,2018-11-01,95618652,Hikari,"Hackerhome is similar to a hostel in Taiwan or Japan in that there are multiple beds in one room, but one thing that is different is the interactions that happens between yourself and the people you share the house with. As much as everyone is there for their own ends and purposes, some ""Hey, how's your day going?"" does happen in the evening, and through those interactions you end up becoming building and being part of the community there."
1334378,346753791,2018-11-09,33457349,Šimon,"Shared room is nothing to worry about if the company is good, and the company HackerHome housed was excellent."
1602634,7129125,2013-09-07,8251974,J,"Daly City HackerHome is bright and airy,  conveniently located within a very short walk to the Bart, and therefore SF.  The bathrooms, beds and linen are very  clean and the beds and accommodation very comy. The  host is exceptionally gracious, welcoming and accommodating. Vic goes well beyond being a host. 
A great welcome to the place and spirit of SF. "
1602634,12992946,2014-05-16,14506927,Hafi,"Vic is a wonderful guy. he makes you feel home. This was an amazing place. The communication was smooth. The big white board had all the cool things on it like places to eat, events and all the important information. I had an amazing time over there. A lot of free stuff, loved it. "
1602634,13225690,2014-05-22,15353723,Ciara,"I stayed in Hackerhome almost for a week. And i'm totally satisfied with it. The house was located in Daly city little bit away from downtown. But there is Bart station which you can get to downtown within 20min right in front of house. So i didn't have any problem hanging around downtown. The house was clean and neighborhood was also safe. Most of all, all the other people who staying in there were so nice. They respected each other. Also Vic was really nice guy! He kept trying to make everybody comfortable in the house. I'll definitely choose this house again when i go back to San Francisco. "
1602634,13518959,2014-05-29,15257657,Mehmet Can,"Vic is a great guy and a wonderful host!

He is always very helpful and answers to your needs about the household quickly. He takes care of the house meticulously. It felt like home! I really enjoyed staying at Vic's place and I would definitely recommend it. He surely deserves 5 stars!"
1602634,14889145,2014-06-28,9670025,Christoph,"This is a great place to stay and meet some hackers, and a good basis to explore the city. The BART stop is less than 5 minutes walking and there's a couple of shops and restaurants about a block away. Nothing fancy, mind you, but you're here to work, right? 

The house was very clean and everyone was nice and respectful. Lots of international people, a little bit like a hostel, but without the party atmosphere. It's a hacker place, not a party place. "
1602634,15549567,2014-07-11,9285734,Josh,"A really nice place to stay, good housemates to stay with. Very easy access to the airport and all the good spots in san francisco on the BART which is a 10min walk from the house. Really good communication with the host thanks vic"
1602634,16591019,2014-07-29,714304,Scott,Vic has a clean place full of wonderful people.  Recommended for hackers.
1602634,17702960,2014-08-16,18077443,Mark,I had an extremely good experience at HackerHome Daly City. It was my first time using Airbnb and I found Vic very easy to deal with. The place is very close to the local BART station which makes it easy to get to both the airport and downtown San Francisco.  
1602634,18431048,2014-08-26,19382126,David,"Das HackerHome war eine perfekte Unterkunft für mich. Liegt etwas außerhalb von SF, aber mit Bart ist man innerhalb kurzer Zeit in Downtown SF. Ich habe viele nette Menschen dort kennengelernt. Leider konnte ich Vic persönlich nicht antreffen, aber Mehmet hat auf alle Fragen eine Antwort gehabt. Vic antwortet innerhalb von Minuten und hatte kurz nach meiner Ankunft bereits sich erkundigt ob alles in Ordnung ist. Super Service. Ich gebe volle 5 Punkte und würde sofort wieder dort wohnen. Nächstes mal jedoch länger als nur 9 Nächte. Alle Mitbewohner waren sehr hilfsbereit. In direkter Umgebung gibt es mehrere Supermärkte und man bekommt alles was man braucht. Sofort wieder und danke dir Vic für die Möglichkeit in SF zu wohnen."
1602634,20522364,2014-09-30,5455490,Sébastien,Nice place :)
1602634,21491353,2014-10-18,21814380,Rabia,"I spent a week here while I was in town for a conference. Vic let me know I would be the only woman in the house and offered to move me to another house in the network, but I opted to stay here since it was on the BART.  The house was very clean and comfortable, and the surrounding area is safe and quiet.  The housemates were a mix of people new to the area looking for a permanent place and people visiting from out of town.  Noise at night and showering in the morning were not issues. If you are traveling on a budget and like being social with people at home, this is the perfect place!  

The BART is a 10 minute walk away, making the airport, Mission District, and convention center extremely convenient. There is a Walgreens and a few places to eat a few blocks away.  I highly recommend both Al Fin and Estrada's - it was featured on Restaurant Impossible!  "
1602634,22382010,2014-11-04,10442706,HyunSic,"Great place to accese BART station (about 10 minute).
Host was very kind. There has big television.
I had nice time. Thank you."
1602634,23023032,2014-11-20,2719731,Judit,"I enjoyed my stay at this place, mostly because I met new people and made good friends with the one only other girl at the house. 
The room was OK, although not much space for your clothes :(( I stayed for 5 days, never unpacked my suitcase due to lack of space. I was staying in a 4 bed dorm room, which was quiet small, but it was perfect for me as I was in town during the whole day and I just went to sleep in the evening. 
Considering the $30 cleaning fee, the bathroom should have been MUCH cleaner!!! On the bright side, Vic provides a towel and there's a blow dryer in the bathroom. 
The area is quiet, but I felt much safer going home with my new friend, rather than alone in the evening. BART train that takes you downtown and to the airport is really close, maybe 10 minute walk. There's a Walgreens also close by. Getting in and out of the house is easy, there's a code system to use. Overall I would recommend this place to fellow airbnb guests, I just hope that the bathroom situation gets better. "
1602634,23280860,2014-11-27,23890735,Akinwale,"Vic was a great host. He was very friendly and helpful, and he provided everything needed. I didn't have any issues during my stay here. The neighbourhood is pretty quiet, which is nice, and there are the Metro Mall and the Serramonte Centre which are a reasonable walking distance from the location."
1602634,28017099,2015-03-16,27838147,Filipe,Gostei muito do bairro e da casa. Próximo a estação de trem Colma (Bart).

1602634,44995026,2015-08-30,41433964,Nicholas,"I was welcomed with a handwritten postcard from Vic, a fresh towel and clean linens. The next day Vic brought us flavored Bagels for the week and Twinkies! The atmosphere of the home is very relaxed, most everyone is a business type and keeps to themselves. There is the occasional loud conversation but nothing that can't be avoided by going in to the bedroom and closing the door. The shower was beautiful and the home gets a perfect cross breeze when the bedroom and living room windows are open. There is plenty of space to do work and plenty of working electrical outlets. The TV even has ChromeCast if you'd like to watch netflix, twitch or any other app from your phone, just ask the other guest if they're okay with you raising the volume. The wifi is fast and reliable. The location is a 5 minute walk to the Colma Bart station. Two refrigerators available, one with communal food and one for personal food. Everything in this house is split up by communal and personal storage. If you ever do want to take a break from people, the backyard is almost always free. If I am ever in need of a stay for myself, my friend or family, I will definitely  recommend this listing."
1602634,48030610,2015-09-22,43594136,Vincent,"My first Airbnb experience, Vic was a kind host, as he took care of my needs, and asked for status many times. The place is pretty well located (around 20 minutes from both downtown and airport) and cheap for S.F. area. I met interesting and nice people during my stay, and would definitely come again."
1602634,77283494,2016-05-31,38702575,Marina,Vic's place was great! His communication wonderful and directions upon entering made easy. Vic made it a point to keep in touch and make sure I was comfortable and had everything I needed. I highly recommend a bnb stay hosted by Vic
1602634,78678357,2016-06-08,55849953,Yvonne,"Vic is a great communicator and tries his best to accommodate his guests. He doesn't live in this home, but he is quick to respond to my emails and texts. He runs various Hacker Homes across the Bay Area, and I only stayed in the Daly City house. The Daly City location seems safe, quiet, and convenient, about a 5 or 10 minute walk to the Colma BART train station. The BART train goes to downtown SF and the SFO airport. A Walgreens store is within walking distance. The home is located on the 2nd floor, so you must carry your luggage up a flight of stairs. Future guests should carefully review both the Airbnb listing details and the House Rules before deciding if this place is right for them. (Remember to bring your own bath towel and other bath essentials.) This is a shared private home that functions like a hostel or dorm, but without a resident house manager. It is expected that each guest should pick up after themselves, such as washing their own dishes, discarding their old food, and keeping the place tidy. There is a female-only room with 4 bunks, a male (or co-ed) room with 6 bunks, and a private room, so 11 guests maximum share 2 full bathrooms. Unfortunately, when I arrived, there was no house manager and the previous cleaning service had done a bad job and/or had not cleaned frequently enough, so the place was very dirty and disorganized with an ant pest problem. The listing was accurate except that I could not do ""light cooking"" on the very dirty stove. The home was probably renovated recently with nice finishes and nice appliances, but since Vic does not live in the home, he unintentionally allowed previous guests to trash what should have been a lovely home. I took photos of the existing messy conditions and I offered Vic my cleaning services and house management skills. Vic agreed, so I will become the Daly City live-in house manager and cleaning service from now until July 31. I had other housing options in the Bay Area, but I felt sympathetic toward the young college-age students and interns who are staying here longer-term over the summer. My conscience would not allow me to leave these kids alone in the mess. It will take me a little while to fully clean out the mess, but hopefully I can set up new house rules and common-sense systems so the guests (and future house manager) can easily maintain the place on their own after I leave. Vic is busy running several HackerHomes, but he seems to have good intentions with his private hostel business of hosting students, interns, ""digital nomad"" workers, tech conference visitors, and vacationers to SF. I'm just a non-tech vacationer, so I've enjoyed meeting the smart ""hacker"" (tech/computer) workers and students in this house who travel from all over the world to be in the Bay Area."
1602634,84975029,2016-07-10,6392340,Cynthia,"I felt comfortable with the cleanliness of the bed linens and bathroom. There was a house manager, Yvonne, on-site that greeted me, helped me check in and get settled. Laundry on-site made it easy and convenient. The home is a close walk to public transit, a walk to the nearest Walgreens or even shopping plaza (Marshalls, Old Navy & Nordstrom Rack) wasn't too difficult.

Understanding this would be a hostel like situation—I honestly didn't have high expectations. I set my mind that this was a place to sleep and shower. I didn't utilize many of the other utilities. Other guests were respectful of space and friendly. The only difficulty maybe the bathroom wait, but even still, that only happened to me once. Overall, I was happy with my stay and have no complaints based on the extent/consideration of the time I used the home!"
1602634,87361805,2016-07-19,75350360,윤아,Good!
1602634,97023719,2016-08-25,88528748,Tom,"The place is clean and comfortable. The roommates are quite nice. Safe neighbourhood and very easy check-in process. Finally, thanks for the fresh fruit Vic :)"
1602634,101868303,2016-09-15,84290604,Blake,"My first time booking with airbnb and I had a blast. 

Vic creates one very unique experience with his locations. Before I even booked, Vic had invited me to come to a cookout with all the other guests who were going to techcrunch disrupt. He told me if I could delay my flight by one day for I could make the cookout, that I could stay an extra night just. He wanted to ensure I didn't leave cali without having a great time. I couldn't believe it. 

I'm so glad that I delayed that flight. I met new friends from all over the world. From Barbados, Italy, Japan, Russia, Australia, Canada...all in a matter of a few hours. Not to mention my roommates were from Taiwan. The discussions I had, connections I made, along with the overall experience made my trip 2x better. "
1602634,134734562,2017-02-28,30724210,Luis,"People I shared the space was great, it is pretty close to public transportation, great cost / benefit."
1602634,188274177,2017-08-28,40043514,Nano,"I had the best time ever on the house ! The people are awesome and they have a beautiful energy, respectful and zero drama. Also Peter and Vic  are really great human beings. "
1602634,201693970,2017-10-08,104575492,Raquelle,It was my first time staying at a hacker house and it was such a good experience. Everyone was so nice :)
1602634,246107838,2018-03-24,178556632,Wilson,Excellent! Great hospitality and even provides us food!
1602634,337597664,2018-10-16,75174509,Duarte,The Hacker Home in Millbrae is awesome. I'll like to thank Matt and Peter to make me feel at home. Two very interesting and cool guys who made me feel like I was living there for months. Thank you guys! I'll never forget the good times we had in the Hacker Home.
1602634,368705971,2019-01-07,226090892,Ren,"everyone sharing the space was super cool and helpful, and the house manager was a great resource for things to do in the area! loved the experience."
1602634,428285876,2019-03-24,148754820,Linda,"I went in late March and the place was pretty full, partly thanks to spring break. I was initially worried about noise but there weren't noise problems, neither from other guests nor flights nearby, which were barely noticeable.
It was actually nice that there were over a dozen guests to talk to! Almost everyone had interesting experiences or projects, and a few people were from abroad. It helped that there was always free coffee in the morning, in the shared kitchen.
As for transportation, both the Caltrain (for going south) and the BART (for going north) were walking distance. No one needed to bring their car.
Shared amenities were good. There was only minimal waiting for the free laundry, which was convenient. I never had to wait for kitchen equipment because there was plenty of both equipment and space. The kitchen was great for networking. The room amenities were good, too. I was placed in the girl's room, which has space between the bunk beds, lots of closet space with extra hangers, and its own separate (and larger) bathroom, but each room is a bit different."
1602655,7063761,2013-09-05,6039774,Chloe,"Vic was very helpful in getting me set up here at the last minute and I really appreciated his hospitality. A good option for those wanting to spend more than a few days exploring SF and stay somewhere affordable. Easy to get into the city and back. Very friendly and accommodating host.

Pros: Comfortable bed, airy apartment, nice fellow guests, clean and well-stocked bathroom. Very clear instructions for getting in and finding my bed. Close to the BART.

Cons: A little stark/sparsely furnished (no silverware, corkscrew, dish soap/sponge). Not great for cooking own food. Neighborhood is residential but a little worn...Try to arrive and get your bearings during daylight."
1602655,14162180,2014-06-13,15596444,Thomas,"Responsive host, convenient location, nice housemates (not all techies).

Cons: Price increased from $35 (IIRC) last month and there is monthly discount so I can't really recommend it for month-long stays."
1602655,17950203,2014-08-19,17054974,Corey,"I plan on moving to San Francisco at a later date so I wanted to take a trip to see what my future home would be like. I am SOOO thankful that Vic exist!! He responds promptly to emails which I find amazing cause he seems like a busy guy. The place was awesome for the price, and you get to meet really cool people in the house. The neighborhood is safe (Walked around pretty late multiple times at night). The house is located close to the Bart train station which is extremely convenient. Mehmet is extremely helpful, and does a GREAT job of taking care of the house and the guest. Thanks to him I have tasted some delicious Cali foods man!! Next time I pass through San Francisco again, I know exactly where I will stay."
1602655,18282875,2014-08-24,8604557,Ruskin,"Accurate description, quiet and safe neighbourhood, super welcoming housemates and host. This was a great base of operations while hunting for something more permanent. The kitchen is well equipped, the bathrooms were clean, the internet worked smoothly, the TV was massive.
Also, great communication about how to find my way there from the airport.
"
1602655,24133224,2014-12-21,20867363,Michael,Vic made me feel very welcome and like family. I definitely would return if I can back to the Bay Are
1602655,25810688,2015-01-26,22871605,Annie,"Vic is a great host! The place was cosy and friendly. A 5-10min walk to Colma Bart station. Also close to Walgreens and bank of America. Target, best buy and malls within 30min walk."
1602655,29151467,2015-04-04,28587141,Wilfred,"I had stayed in one of Vic's other locations and contacted him again and he was quick to respond and was able to accommodate me for a stay before I headed out to another city.  

Vic was also helpful in giving/sourcing me some suggestions for my stay in Portland!  
"
1602655,31014366,2015-04-30,7602951,Daniel,"I never met Vic, he seems like a nice guy but when I turned up the place was a mess, nothing like what is portrayed on airbnb. Had to sift through dirty dishes, then clean a bowl just to eat breakfast.

If I wasn't forced to pay for a weeks accommodation in advance I wouldn't have stayed. Not the experience I was expecting"
1602655,51219474,2015-10-18,42913310,Nicolas,"My stay in the hackerhome of Daly city was perfect: nice and funny people in it, near SF with Bart (metro north-south), it was an awesome moment for me and I feel lucky to have chosen this house. You will definitely have a great time there!"
1602655,52359028,2015-10-28,20824436,David,Amazing - loved the roommates and ease 
1602655,61035220,2016-01-31,50019501,Apoorv,"Vic is a great host and I had the best 2 months there. The location is very near to BART and everyone at the house was very laid-back, helpful and friendly."
1602655,99971237,2016-09-06,43824842,Keisuke,"Thank you for amazing house.
It was fun and clean room and amenities.
Even though it was my first trip to US, for Vic's help it was nothing to get trouble. It was so smoothly to get there.
And share mates are also nice!"
1602655,107207172,2016-10-09,26411925,Christian,Die Bilder geben nicht soviel her. Is n bisschen schmuddelich... aber fürn paar Tage zum pennen... Y not?
1602655,140761568,2017-03-31,30724210,Luis,Great place!
1602655,198530745,2017-09-29,10061345,Wayne,Vic was extremely amazing in helping me with working out my reservation schedules. Everyone at the house was very friendly and came from different parts of the world. The conversations at night are truly what makes this place one of a kind. Would definitely come back some day just to meet interesting people and make new friends.
1602655,297349787,2018-07-27,176488143,Fredrik,"Very nice people, Pete was exceptionally helpful and provided both good advise and friendship."
1602655,346188380,2018-11-07,221012382,Troy,It was great staying at a place that valued their guests.
1602655,364960821,2018-12-31,200025120,Sevgi,"The place is amazing, very nice people, I totally recommend it. Vic,Peter and Mat are kind and helpful."
1602655,442567503,2019-04-23,177275886,Duane,Convenient location. Friendly roommates.      Had kind of a college dorm room feel.
